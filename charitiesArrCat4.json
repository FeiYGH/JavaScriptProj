Toxic pollutants affect the health of more than 200 million people worldwide. The number of people affected is comparable to HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. Yet pollution is one of the most underreported and underfunded problems in the world. The majority of acutely toxic sites are caused by local business, many of them artisanal or small-scale. Abandoned sites are also quite common. Surprisingly, international companies are rarely implicated.

The Houston Parks Board's primary programs are its Park Creation Campaign (acquiring parkland to create new parks and expand existing parks) and its Park Improvement Projects (creating new amenities or renovating existing facilities).","websiteURL":"http://www.houstonparksboard.org","tagLine":"Creating, improving and protecting parkland for Houston","charityName":"Houston Parks Board","ein":"741860046","orgID":6347,"currentRating":{"score":94.34,"ratingID":145268,"publicationDate":"2019-09-03T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":100,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":92,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Environment","categoryID":4,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/education.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":10,"causeName":"Botanical Gardens, Parks, and Nature Centers","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=4&cuid=10&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/botanical_gardens.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":73670038,"nteeType":"Philanthropy, Voluntarism and Grantmaking Foundations","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":33821208,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"May, 1987","nteeCode":"T30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Public Foundations","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"T"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"TX","city":"Houston","postalCode":"77024","streetAddress1":"300 North Post Oak Lane","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/741860046/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Houston Parks Board","ein":"741860046","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6347&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/741860046"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13984&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The mission of the San Antonio Botanical Garden society is to inspire people to connect with the plant world and understand the importance of plants in our lives.

The Biomimicry Institute was founded in 2006 by Janine Benyus and Bryony Schwan to share nature's design lessons with the people who design and make our world. Our goal today is for biomimicry to become a natural part of the design process. We accomplish this by tackling one massive sustainability problem at a time through our Design Challenges platform, mobilizing tens of thousands of practitioners with the support of the Global Biomimicry Network to solve the challenge, and then providing those practitioners with AskNature as a tool to begin the solution process. We anticipate dozens of new biomimetic innovations will result, creating a healthier world for all.","websiteURL":"https://biomimicry.org/","tagLine":"Creating nature-inspired solutions for a healthy planet","charityName":"Biomimicry Institute","ein":"861153859","orgID":17066,"currentRating":{"score":84.21,"ratingID":143904,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":79.16,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":92,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Environment","categoryID":4,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/education.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":11,"causeName":"Environmental Protection and Conservation","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=4&cuid=11&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/environmental_protection.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":723856,"nteeType":"Science and Technology Research Institutes, Services","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":1222854,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Scientific Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"February, 2007","nteeCode":"U50","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Biological, Life Science Research","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"U"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MT","city":"Missoula","postalCode":"59807","streetAddress1":"P.O.

We work closely with federal and state policymakers to advance hiker's interests in forest planning and new recreation projects.","websiteURL":"http://www.wta.org","tagLine":"Protecting and maintaining our hiking trails","charityName":"Washington Trails Association","ein":"910900134","orgID":10785,"currentRating":{"score":94.48,"ratingID":148083,"publicationDate":"2019-11-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":93.31,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Environment","categoryID":4,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/education.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":11,"causeName":"Environmental Protection and Conservation","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=4&cuid=11&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/environmental_protection.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":7641196,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":4601549,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"September, 1980","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"WA","city":"Seattle","postalCode":"98104","streetAddress1":"705 Second Avenue","streetAddress2":"Suite 300"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/910900134/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Washington Trails Association","ein":"910900134","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10785&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/910900134"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15165&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Climate Solutions' mission is to accelerate clean energy solutions to the climate crisis.
