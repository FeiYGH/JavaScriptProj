Progeria is a fatal, \"rapid aging\" disease that afflicts children, who die of heart disease at an average age of 13 years - the same heart disease affecting millions of normal aging adults. The Progeria Research Foundation (PRF) was founded in 1999 in response to the lack of resources for doctors, scientists, patients, and families of those with Progeria. PRF has been the driving force behind the tremendous progress in the field, moving from total obscurity, to gene discovery, to first-ever drug treatment in just 13 years. PRF is the only non-profit solely dedicated to finding treatments and the cure for Progeria, and is hailed as a prime example of a successful translational research organization.

The research center performs groundbreaking investigations into the cause of MS, biomarker research aimed at developing precise diagnostic and predictive tools to bring the disease under the control of treating neurologists, and novel regenerative strategies for repairing the damage done by the disease in patients who are unresponsive to standard treatments.","websiteURL":"http://tischms.org/","tagLine":"Dedicated to finding the cause of and cure for multiple sclerosis","charityName":"Tisch MS Research Center of New York","ein":"251922851","orgID":17170,"currentRating":{"score":90.78,"ratingID":150763,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":89.72,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":92,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Health","categoryID":5,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/environment.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":14,"causeName":"Medical Research","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=5&cuid=14&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/medical_research.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":8934106,"nteeType":"Medical Research","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":9212723,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"August, 2015","nteeCode":"H48","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Brain Disorders Research","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"H"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10019","streetAddress1":"521 W. 57th Street","streetAddress2":"4th Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/251922851/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Tisch MS Research Center of New York","ein":"251922851","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17170&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/251922851"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15719&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"A Kids' Brain Tumor Cure Foundation (a/k/a PLGA Foundation), founded in 2007, is dedicated to finding more effective, less toxic and less punishing treatments for eradicating low grade glioma brain cancer in children.

We not only help families address these problems, we provide solutions through the Ronald McDonald House of Augusta and our RMHCA Scholarship Program.","websiteURL":"http://rmhcaugusta.org/","tagLine":"A Home Away From Home","charityName":"Ronald McDonald House Charities of Augusta","ein":"581509465","orgID":16688,"currentRating":{"score":88.54,"ratingID":150403,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":84.3,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Health","categoryID":5,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/environment.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":34,"causeName":"Patient and Family Support","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=5&cuid=34&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/patient_and_family_support.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":6498175,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":859638,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"July, 1983","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"GA","city":"Augusta","postalCode":"30901","streetAddress1":"1442 Harper Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/581509465/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Ronald McDonald House Charities of Augusta","ein":"581509465","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=16688&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/581509465"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5530&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"National Foundation for Transplants (NFT) offers hope to transplant patients by helping them overcome financial obstacles that may prevent or delay their lifesaving transplants.

All children between the ages of two and a half and eighteen who have been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness and either live or are treated in Northeast Florida or Southeast Georgia are eligible for a dream.","websiteURL":"http://www.dreamscometrue.org/","tagLine":"Bringing hope and the promise of tomorrow","charityName":"Dreams Come True of Jacksonville","ein":"592967803","orgID":9624,"currentRating":{"score":94.63,"ratingID":150802,"publicationDate":"2020-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":97.07,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":93,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Health","categoryID":5,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/environment.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":34,"causeName":"Patient and Family Support","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=5&cuid=34&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/patient_and_family_support.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":5976750,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":2820400,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"January, 1990","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"FL","city":"Jacksonville","postalCode":"32216","streetAddress1":"6803 Southpoint Parkway","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/592967803/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Dreams Come True of Jacksonville","ein":"592967803","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9624&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/592967803"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=4529&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1996, Camp Boggy Creek is a year-round medical camp for children with serious illnesses.

The magic we provide by granting a wish gets the whole family out of the hospital and offers them a time of fun and togetherness.","websiteURL":"http://colorado.wish.org/","tagLine":"Share the power of a wish","charityName":"Make-A-Wish Foundation of Colorado","ein":"742273004","orgID":8496,"currentRating":{"score":83.99,"ratingID":148767,"publicationDate":"2019-12-20T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":77.56,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":97,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Health","categoryID":5,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/environment.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":34,"causeName":"Patient and Family Support","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=5&cuid=34&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/patient_and_family_support.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":3413242,"nteeType":"Health - General and Rehabilitative","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":5279752,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"August, 2018","rulingDate":"August, 1983","nteeCode":"E86","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Patient Services - Entertainment, Recreation","accountingPeriod":"August","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"E"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CO","city":"Greenwood Village","postalCode":"80111","streetAddress1":"7951 East Maplewood Avenue","streetAddress2":"Suite 126"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/742273004/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Make-A-Wish Foundation of Colorado","ein":"742273004","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8496&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/742273004"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13003&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Texas creates, finds and supports programs that directly improve the health and well being of children and their families.

It is an appropriate name since, ultimately, all of Shanti's direct service and educational programs are aimed at easing the burdens and improving the well-being of people in difficult life situations. Key to the success of Shanti's mission is the Shanti model of peer support, which is both a philosophy and a set of techniques that are used throughout our work.
