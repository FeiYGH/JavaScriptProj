Our current projects and project-states reflect our growing knowledge about how to move abortion access where this work is needed most.","websiteURL":"http://provideaccess.org/","tagLine":"Everyone Has A Role","charityName":"Provide","ein":"043298538","orgID":16329,"currentRating":{"score":93.8,"ratingID":146392,"publicationDate":"2019-09-03T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":96.44,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":92,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human and Civil Rights","categoryID":8,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=8&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/international.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":21,"causeName":"Advocacy and Education","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=8&cuid=21&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/advocacy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":2906008,"nteeType":"Civil Rights, Social Action, Advocacy","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":4699457,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"March, 1996","nteeCode":"R61","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Reproductive Rights","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"R"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MA","city":"Cambridge","postalCode":"02141","streetAddress1":"PO Box 410164","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/043298538/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Provide","ein":"043298538","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=16329&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/043298538"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14756&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"South Coastal Counties Legal Services (SCCLS) provides free civil legal services to low-income and elderly residents of our communities.

Specifically we work to: secure major reforms in the administration of a broad array of programs that promote economic security; eliminate unlawful patterns and practices that deny aid to eligible persons; promote policies that address barriers to employment; and much more.","websiteURL":"http://www.nclej.org","tagLine":"Advancing the cause of economic justice for low-income families, individuals, and communities","charityName":"National Center for Law and Economic Justice","ein":"237311208","orgID":10541,"currentRating":{"score":81.03,"ratingID":147014,"publicationDate":"2019-10-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":75.54,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human and Civil Rights","categoryID":8,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=8&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/international.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":21,"causeName":"Advocacy and Education","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=8&cuid=21&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/advocacy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":2463227,"nteeType":"Crime, Legal-Related","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":2461835,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"September, 1973","nteeCode":"I83","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Public Interest Law, Litigation","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"I"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10001","streetAddress1":"275 Seventh Avenue","streetAddress2":"Suite 1506"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/237311208/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"National Center for Law and Economic Justice","ein":"237311208","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10541&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/237311208"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15006&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The ACLU of Massachusetts exists to defend and promote the principle of \"liberty and justice for ALL!\" A private, voluntary, nonpartisan organization, we use integrated litigation, legislative advocacy, education and organizing strategies to defend and preserve the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the U.S. Constitution.

It embraces an objective framework of moral values, but also recognizes and appreciates the subjective nature of economic value. It views justice as a duty of all to give the one his due but, more importantly, as an individual obligation to serve the common good and not just his own needs and wants.

The Sentencing Project is dedicated to changing the way Americans think about crime and punishment.","websiteURL":"http://www.sentencingproject.org/","tagLine":"Research and advocacy for reform","charityName":"The Sentencing Project","ein":"521472546","orgID":10364,"currentRating":{"score":81.11,"ratingID":145543,"publicationDate":"2019-09-03T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":93.9,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":74,"rating":2}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human and Civil Rights","categoryID":8,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=8&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/international.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":21,"causeName":"Advocacy and Education","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=8&cuid=21&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/advocacy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":2993281,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":1778128,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"April, 1987","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"DC","city":"Washington","postalCode":"20036","streetAddress1":"1705 DeSales Street, NW","streetAddress2":"Eighth Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521472546/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"The Sentencing Project","ein":"521472546","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10364&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521472546"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6229&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Through research, educational efforts and outreach, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation encourages gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans to live their lives openly and seeks to change the hearts and minds of Americans to the side of equality.

NAPW uses the lessons learned from the experiences of these women to find more effective ways of advancing reproductive and human rights for all women and families. Our work encompasses legal advocacy; local and national organizing; public policy development, and public education. NAPW is actively involved in ongoing court challenges to punitive reproductive health and drug policies and provides litigation support in cases across the country. NAPW engages in local and national organizing and public education efforts among the diverse communities that are stakeholders in these issues, including the women and families directly affected by punitive policies, as well as public health and policy leaders. By focusing on the rights of all pregnant women, whether they seek to have an abortion or go to term , NAPW is broadening and strengthening the Reproductive Justice and other progressive movements. NAPW recognizes that 61% of women who have abortions are already mothers and 84% of women by the time they are in their 40's have become pregnant and given birth. We believe that you cannot have a culture of life if you do not value the women who give that life.","websiteURL":"http://www.advocatesforpregnantwomen.org","tagLine":"Protecting the rights and human dignity of all women.","charityName":"National Advocates for Pregnant Women","ein":"522282183","orgID":11477,"currentRating":{"score":92.9,"ratingID":143517,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":90.8,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human and Civil Rights","categoryID":8,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=8&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/international.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":21,"causeName":"Advocacy and Education","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=8&cuid=21&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/advocacy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":5956994,"nteeType":"Civil Rights, Social Action, Advocacy","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":3301428,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"April, 2001","nteeCode":"R24","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Women's Rights","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"R"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10011","streetAddress1":"875 6th Avenue","streetAddress2":"Suite 1807"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/522282183/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"National Advocates for Pregnant Women","ein":"522282183","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11477&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/522282183"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8966&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Jewish Women International (JWI) was born in 1897 just as 19th century women were beginning to emerge from the home and into the public sphere.

In addition to the litigation for which the ACLU-NC has been known over the past seven decades, we also educate the public, inform the media, lobby legislators, organize grassroots activists, and disseminate information about our constitutional freedoms through our membership and volunteer chapters.","websiteURL":"http://www.aclunc.org/","tagLine":"Protecting civil liberties in California since 1934","charityName":"American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Northern California","ein":"940279770","orgID":7423,"currentRating":{"score":91.13,"ratingID":144363,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":88.12,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human and Civil Rights","categoryID":8,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=8&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/international.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":21,"causeName":"Advocacy and Education","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=8&cuid=21&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/advocacy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":null,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":null,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"March, 2018","rulingDate":"October, 1962","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"March","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CA","city":"San Francisco","postalCode":"94111","streetAddress1":"39 Drumm Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/940279770/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Northern California","ein":"940279770","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7423&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/940279770"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17579&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) is a national organization whose ongoing mission is to secure and maintain the civil rights of Japanese Americans and all others who are victimized by injustice and bigotry.
