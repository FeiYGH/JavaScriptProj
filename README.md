#Comparing Charities Over 50 State and Territories
## An interactive graph that depicts 11 categories of nonprofits across US states and territories. 

1. Each charity to be represented by a circle, colored ordinally based upon charity category, where size is proportional to its income.
2. Data about all charities are gathered from API calls to Charity Navigator.

3. Set up a filter where user can selectively show one category or all categories of nonprofits.
4. Graph plays through data from all the states.
5. I put in buttons "Play" and "Pause" to allow user to play and pause through the presentation. 
6. Set up a state slider allowing user to go to whatever state they want
