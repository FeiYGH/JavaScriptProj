BLUEBARN is dedicated to theatre's most important tradition: to provoke thought, emotion, action, and change. The BLUEBARN Theatre has long established itself as Omaha's premier professional theatre. After producing over 100 plays since 1989, the BLUEBARN's reputation for high-quality entertainment and pursuit of stories that challenge both the theatre artists and patrons is solid. The BLUEBARN's primary goals are to bring in more professional actors and designers from around the country and to increase awareness of the BLUEBARN in Omaha and surrounding communities.","websiteURL":"http://bluebarn.org/","tagLine":"BLUEBARN is dedicated to theatre's most important tradition: to provoke thought, emotion, action, and change.","charityName":"BLUEBARN Theatre","ein":"470742394","orgID":15798,"currentRating":{"score":82.68,"ratingID":144882,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":91.6,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":77,"rating":2}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":4,"causeName":"Performing Arts","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/performing_arts.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":6200086,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":1271704,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"July, 1991","nteeCode":"A65","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Theater","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NE","city":"Omaha","postalCode":"68108","streetAddress1":"1106 South 10th Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/470742394/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"BLUEBARN Theatre","ein":"470742394","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15798&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/470742394"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5369&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Catholic Social Services (CSS) of Southern Nebraska traces its beginnings to 1932 when Bishop Louis Kucera founded CSS to respond to the needs of persons suffering the effects of the Great Depression.
