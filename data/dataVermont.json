GMC volunteers and staff teach low-impact practices and safety skills that outdoor enthusiasts use whenever they hit the backwoods. Through its land protection program in northern Vermont, the Club has protected more than fifty-five miles of the Long Trail System and 16,000 acres of backcountry land.","websiteURL":"http://www.greenmountainclub.org/","tagLine":"Maintaining and protecting Vermont's Long Trail since 1910","charityName":"Green Mountain Club","ein":"030162865","orgID":8336,"currentRating":{"score":87.16,"ratingID":144429,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":85.57,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Environment","categoryID":4,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/education.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":11,"causeName":"Environmental Protection and Conservation","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=4&cuid=11&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/environmental_protection.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":11725721,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":4047016,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"April, 2019","rulingDate":"April, 1979","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"April","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"VT","city":"Waterbury Center","postalCode":"05677","streetAddress1":"4711 Waterbury-Stowe Road","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/030162865/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Green Mountain Club","ein":"030162865","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8336&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/030162865"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10002&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"New England Kurn Hattin Homes was founded in 1894 by Reverend Charles Albert Dickinson, who believed that young children in need or orphans could be cared for in a nurturing rural setting rather than the urban childcare institution which existed at the time.

REAP helps pastoral families by mapping the barriers to overcoming extreme poverty and then implementing a series of sequenced interventions with a defined exit strategy. To date, we have reached more than 159,684 women and children. Our ultimate goal is not just to have an impact; it is to achieve true systems change by embedding the resilience-building approach into social protection and humanitarian systems.","websiteURL":"https://bomaproject.org/","tagLine":"Empowering women to end extreme poverty","charityName":"The BOMA Project","ein":"841671995","orgID":18415,"currentRating":{"score":93.74,"ratingID":150885,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":94.6,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":93,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":20,"causeName":"Development and Relief Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=20&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/development_relief.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1568769,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":3163127,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"September, 2018","rulingDate":"January, 2006","nteeCode":"Q31","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"September","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"VT","city":"Manchester Center","postalCode":"05255","streetAddress1":"P.O.

The Foundation is also assisting in the development of a tradition of private individual and corporate support of the arts within Russia. The arts offer a unique opportunity to deepen cross-cultural understanding, to bring the world closer through cultural exchange and education. The arts demonstrate and emphasize our common humanity, promoting globalism instead of isolationism, community instead of conflict.
