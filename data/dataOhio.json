Founded in 1895, the CSO proudly serves the Greater Cincinnati community as the fifth oldest orchestra in the United States and the first orchestra in the state of Ohio. The CSO is no stranger to the national spotlight, as it became the third orchestra to professionally record in 1917 and the first orchestra to be broadcast to a national radio audience in 1921. These early achievements have paved the way for the CSO's continued longevity and success.
