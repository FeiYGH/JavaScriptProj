In 1998, Make Way for Books' founder Dr. Mary Jan Bancroft answered a newspaper listing to read to four-year-olds at a preschool in Tucson. Mary Jan found that this center did not have age-appropriate, quality picture books. Deciding to explore this need further, Mary Jan found that most of the childcare centers serving economically-disadvantaged children had few to zero quality books for young children. That same year, Mary Jan founded Make Way for Books (MWFB) to meet this incredible need and began providing books to under-resourced sites and offering early literacy workshops for educators and parents. Today, MWFB has provided services to nearly 300 preschools and childcare centers. Each year, MWFB serves more than 30,000 children and families and 700 educators.","websiteURL":"http://makewayforbooks.org/","tagLine":"Sharing stories changes lives, especially young lives","charityName":"Make Way for Books","ein":"311583036","orgID":17075,"currentRating":{"score":94.7,"ratingID":150424,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":97.35,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":93,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":36,"causeName":"Early Childhood Programs and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=36&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/early_childhood.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":2269564,"nteeType":"Educational Institutions and Related Activities","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":1681137,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"March, 1998","nteeCode":"B92","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Remedial Reading, Reading Encouragement","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"B"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"AZ","city":"Tucson","postalCode":"85705","streetAddress1":"700 North Stone Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/311583036/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Make Way for Books","ein":"311583036","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17075&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/311583036"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11759&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Feeding America's Hungry Children's (FAHC) network of more than 17 regional food banks and food-rescue organizations serves 16 states by distributing food and grocery products to approximately 100 local charitable hunger relief agencies including food pantries, soup kitchens, women's shelters, Community Kitchens, and other organizations that provide emergency food assistance.
