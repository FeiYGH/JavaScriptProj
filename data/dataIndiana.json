In pursuit of this mission, Community Harvest solicits surplus food and grocery donations from the food industry, regional farmers, and through community food drives. The food is sorted, inspected for quality, and readied for distribution to the hungry via a member agency network of nearly 400 nonprofit pantries, churches, and social service agencies.
