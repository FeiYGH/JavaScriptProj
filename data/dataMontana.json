The retreats offer opportunities for women to find inspiration, discover renewed energy for life and experience healing connections with other women and nature. CfR's retreats are open to women with breast cancer of all ages, in all stages of treatment and recovery, and are free to participants. On a physical level, the gentle, rhythmic motion of fly casting is similar to exercises often prescribed after surgery or radiation to promote soft tissue stretching. On an emotional level, women are given the opportunity to experience a new activity in a safe environment amongst a supportive group of peers. The retreats also provide resources to help address quality of life issues after a breast cancer diagnosis.","websiteURL":"http://www.castingforrecovery.org","tagLine":"CfR provides healing retreats at no cost to women of any age and at any stage of breast cancer treatment or recovery.","charityName":"Casting for Recovery","ein":"030354382","orgID":10189,"currentRating":{"score":95.04,"ratingID":149774,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":99.6,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":93,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Health","categoryID":5,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/environment.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":34,"causeName":"Patient and Family Support","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=5&cuid=34&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/patient_and_family_support.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1772912,"nteeType":"Health - General and Rehabilitative","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":1747515,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"January, 1998","nteeCode":"E50","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Rehabilitative Medical Services","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"E"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MT","city":"Bozeman","postalCode":"59715","streetAddress1":"109 E.

Our goal today is for biomimicry to become a natural part of the design process. We accomplish this by tackling one massive sustainability problem at a time through our Design Challenges platform, mobilizing tens of thousands of practitioners with the support of the Global Biomimicry Network to solve the challenge, and then providing those practitioners with AskNature as a tool to begin the solution process.
