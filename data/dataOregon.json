The National Psoriasis Foundation is the voice for millions of Americans who are affected by psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Our mission is to find a cure for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and to eliminate their devastating effects through research, advocacy and education.","websiteURL":"http://www.psoriasis.org","tagLine":"The voice for millions of Americans who are affected by psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis","charityName":"National Psoriasis Foundation","ein":"930571472","orgID":6413,"currentRating":{"score":91.44,"ratingID":141560,"publicationDate":"2019-06-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":88.28,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":97,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Health","categoryID":5,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/environment.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":13,"causeName":"Diseases, Disorders, and Disciplines","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=5&cuid=13&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/diseases.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":12437744,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":18191364,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"December, 1968","nteeCode":"G46","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"G"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"OR","city":"Portland","postalCode":"97223","streetAddress1":"6600 Southwest 92nd Avenue","streetAddress2":"Suite 300"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/930571472/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"National Psoriasis Foundation","ein":"930571472","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6413&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/930571472"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6414&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"Heartland Humane Society is a local animal welfare organization, founded in Benton County by a number of compassionate citizens in 1966.
