GRS uses the power of soccer to connect young people with the mentors, information, and health services they need to thrive, and empowers adolescents to make educated choices about pressing health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, sexual health, gender-based violence, and malaria. GRS's evidence-based programs, led by trained local mentors (Caring Coaches), incorporate soccer into dynamic lessons about health and wellness that engage young people and break down cultural barriers. With proven results and a constant focus on research and innovation, GRS has reached over 2 million young people in nearly 50 countries with adolescent-friendly health education.","websiteURL":"http://www.grassrootsoccer.org/","tagLine":"Educate.
