(PAI) was founded in 1969 to address the dropout crisis plaguing Philadelphia schools. The initial thrust of PAI's work was on implementation and management of Career Academies, a specific model of career-connected learning created by PAI's founders that has since been put into action in over 8,000 schools nationally. While still providing technical assistance in implementing the Academy Model, PAI has now created a more diverse portfolio of career-connected services offered outside the Academy framework that provide varying levels of engagement and structure: Work-Based Learning, Career Pathways and Pre-Apprenticeship Programs. <br><br>PAI envisions a world where all young people have the skills, resources and networks to reach their full potential.","websiteURL":"http://www.academiesinc.org","tagLine":"Connecting students to industry and industry to schools","charityName":"Philadelphia Academies Inc.","ein":"222442433","orgID":17321,"currentRating":{"score":82.09,"ratingID":142613,"publicationDate":"2019-06-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":75,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":41,"causeName":"Education Policy and Reform","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=41&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/education_policy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":657130,"nteeType":"Educational Institutions and Related Activities","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":1854086,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"May, 1983","nteeCode":"B30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Vocational, Technical Schools","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"B"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"PA","city":"Philadelphia","postalCode":"19102","streetAddress1":"1401 Walnut Street","streetAddress2":"9th Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/222442433/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Philadelphia Academies Inc.","ein":"222442433","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17321&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/222442433"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17144&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"Helping Harvest works to feed the hungry by acquiring and distributing food to people in need.

We conduct research on pressing issues - the war on terrorism, developments in the Middle East, nuclear proliferation in South Asia, relations with China, Russia, and Japan - and long-term questions, such as the roles of religion and ethnicity in international politics, or the nature of Western identity and its implications for the U.S. and the Atlantic Alliance. Through our quarterly journal, Orbis, and the Wachman Center for International and Civic Literacy, we educate the public and in this way, we serve the community and the nation, the policymakers and the educators.","websiteURL":"http://www.fpri.org/","tagLine":"\"A nation must think before it acts.\" - Robert Strausz-Hupé","charityName":"Foreign Policy Research Institute","ein":"231731998","orgID":8952,"currentRating":{"score":92.17,"ratingID":149651,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":88.94,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":19,"causeName":"International Peace, Security, and Affairs","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=19&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/international_peace.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1462433,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":"5","incomeAmount":2072939,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"December, 1970","nteeCode":"Q05","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Research Institutes and/or Public Policy Analysis ","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"PA","city":"Philadelphia","postalCode":"19102","streetAddress1":"1528 Walnut Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 610"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/231731998/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Foreign Policy Research Institute","ein":"231731998","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8952&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/231731998"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9987&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"The mission of Legacy Youth Tennis and Education is to prepare young people, especially those from under-resourced families and communities, through innovative tennis, education, life skills, and leadership development programming.
