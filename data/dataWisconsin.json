MOWA has transformed itself from a small community-based gallery to America's only regional art museum featuring the works of Wisconsin artists. The richness of Wisconsin art is reflective in its landscapes and history – from the breathtaking lakes and rolling hills carved out by the massive glaciers and pastures to factories and cities created by the early settlers and industrialists, to modern day metropolis. As the only museum in the world dedicated to collecting and maintaining works from Wisconsin, MOWA provides an insight to the human condition that is unavailable anywhere else.","websiteURL":"http://www.wisconsinart.org/","tagLine":"The pre-eminent resource for the visual arts of Wisconsin","charityName":"Museum of Wisconsin Art","ein":"391017647","orgID":15764,"currentRating":{"score":89.02,"ratingID":150334,"publicationDate":"2020-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":93.3,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":86,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":3,"causeName":"Museums","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/museums.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":11326792,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":2822685,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"March, 1964","nteeCode":"A54","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"History Museums","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"WI","city":"West Bend","postalCode":"53095","streetAddress1":"205 Veterans Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/391017647/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Museum of Wisconsin Art","ein":"391017647","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15764&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/391017647"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14316&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"Oshkosh Area United Way (OAUW), a local nonprofit organization, was established in 1962.

The founders were local clergy, businesspeople, and community leaders. They were concerned about low income people not having emergency access to the basic necessities of life, not knowing where to turn for help, and the number of individuals who were going from place to place (particularly to churches) seeking assistance. Duplications of effort, and the real possibility of a few taking advantage of the charity of others, were also of great concern. The agency began with a tiny budget, a few volunteers, and a very part-time staff person. Since 1987, the agency has grown in budget, staff, and number of volunteers. There are currently over 200 volunteers that donate over 17,000 hours each year. This is equivalent to 8.3 full time employees and 67% of all hours worked. It has grown tremendously in its capacity for effective administration, raising money, growing endowments, and caring for the less fortunate in the Fox Valley Area.","websiteURL":"http://www.leavenfoxcities.org/","tagLine":"Turning Hardship Into Hope.","charityName":"Leaven","ein":"391572168","orgID":14315,"currentRating":{"score":89.98,"ratingID":152536,"publicationDate":"2020-05-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":91.08,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":29,"causeName":"Social Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=29&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/social_services.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":6165464,"nteeType":"Human Services - Multipurpose and Other","nteeSuffix":"L","incomeAmount":1916752,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"May, 1987","nteeCode":"P20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Human Service Organizations - Multipurpose","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"P"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"WI","city":"Menasha","postalCode":"54952","streetAddress1":"1475 Opportunity Way","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/391572168/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Leaven","ein":"391572168","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14315&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/391572168"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15767&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"The mission of the Children's Theatre of Madison (CTM) is to create vibrant theater experiences that engage, educate & inspire young people and their communities.
