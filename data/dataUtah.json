The role of the Utah Sports Commission is to act as facilitator, catalyst, coordinator, ombudsman, salesman, cheerleader or any other role that might be helpful or necessary to assist the various sports related organizations in Utah in attracting events, revenue, athlete development opportunities, and positive exposure to the state. The Utah Sports Commission is playing and will continue to play a vital coordinating role in the Utah sports community. An umbrella sports organization such as the Sports Commission allows Utah to brand and position itself in the global sports marketplace more effectively than if multiple organizations and venues were to attempt this on their own.","websiteURL":"http://www.utahsportscommission.com/","tagLine":"Utah: The State of Sport","charityName":"Utah Sports Commission","ein":"870651075","orgID":13660,"currentRating":{"score":83.85,"ratingID":150095,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":87.33,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":81,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":15,"causeName":"Multipurpose Human Service Organizations","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=15&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/multipurpose.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":12835491,"nteeType":"Recreation, Sports, Leisure, Athletics","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":3368319,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"September, 2018","rulingDate":"October, 2000","nteeCode":"N70","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Amateur Sports Competitions","accountingPeriod":"September","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"N"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"UT","city":"Salt Lake City","postalCode":"84111","streetAddress1":"201 South Main Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 2125"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/870651075/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Utah Sports Commission","ein":"870651075","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13660&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/870651075"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13261&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"And Justice for All believes access to justice is a fundamental right in our society.
