We aim to create a hunger-free community and believe that service to others is fundamental to creating that. With dedicated shipping docks, frozen storage capacity, shelving areas for food drive donations and a designated backpack packing area, we serve with compassion and responsiveness to meet the needs of those with whom we work – internally and externally. The better we serve, the more people we bring together in commitment to our vision!","websiteURL":"https://harvestregionalfoodbank.org/","tagLine":"Together we can solve hunger.","charityName":"Harvest Texarkana","ein":"752671647","orgID":17062,"currentRating":{"score":80.49,"ratingID":151300,"publicationDate":"2020-04-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":80,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":81,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":18,"causeName":"Food Banks, Food Pantries, and Food Distribution","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=18&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/food_banks.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1628717,"nteeType":"Food, Agriculture and Nutrition","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":5733360,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"July, 2011","nteeCode":"K30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Food Service, Free Food Distribution Programs","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"K"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"AR","city":"Texarkana","postalCode":"71854","streetAddress1":"3120 East 19th Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/752671647/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Harvest Texarkana","ein":"752671647","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17062&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/752671647"}}}}]
