In 1988, our shelter opened in the middle of a 35.8 acre wildlife sanctuary in Northern Baltimore County. We hold adoptable animals for as long as it takes to find each and every one a forever home. We have adopted out almost 24,000 animals. Our adoption rate is about 97%. Defenders of Animal Rights offers a variety of programs to benefit both the animals and the community. They include a pet adoption center; wildlife and farm animal sanctuary; animal rescues and veterinary care; rehabilitation of abused, neglected and abandoned animals; low cost spay/neuter program; grief counseling; and humane education.","websiteURL":"http://www.adopt-a-pet.org/","tagLine":"The scales of justice must be equal for all God's creatures","charityName":"Defenders of Animal Rights","ein":"521061126","orgID":7085,"currentRating":{"score":83.67,"ratingID":149081,"publicationDate":"2020-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":93.02,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":78,"rating":2}},"category":{"categoryName":"Animals","categoryID":1,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=1&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/animals.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":2,"causeName":"Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=1&cuid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/animal_rights.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":9198598,"nteeType":"Animal-Related","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":1841964,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Organization to Prevent Cruelty to Animals","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"October, 1976","nteeCode":"D20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Animal Protection and Welfare","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"D"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MD","city":"Phoenix","postalCode":"21131","streetAddress1":"14412 Old York Road","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521061126/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Defenders of Animal Rights","ein":"521061126","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7085&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521061126"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5403&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Interfaith Works, formerly known as Community Ministry of Montgomery County, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit agency and a non-sectarian interfaith coalition of more the 165 affiliated congregations of diverse faiths, working together to meet the needs of the poor and homeless in Montgomery County, Maryland.
