WorldServe's primary strategy is the drilling of boreholes for water wells. WorldServe works in partnership with local leaders to ensure that well sites are built and maintained for sustainability. A key outcome is that, instead of walking several hours to a dirty water source, village women and girls can secure clean water in perhaps 15 minutes, allowing economy and education to flourish as time is spent more productively. Health issues diminish further as hygiene can be learned and practiced.","websiteURL":"http://www.worldserveintl.org/","tagLine":"To Provide Clean Water, Sanitation, Education and Economic Opportunities to Alleviate Suffering.","charityName":"Worldserve International","ein":"431535009","orgID":16457,"currentRating":{"score":81.08,"ratingID":143667,"publicationDate":"2019-10-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":86.33,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":77,"rating":2}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":20,"causeName":"Development and Relief Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=20&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/development_relief.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":2080408,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":3674472,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"July, 1996","nteeCode":"Q30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"International Development, Relief Services","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MO","city":"Springfield","postalCode":"65808","streetAddress1":"PO Box 3437","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/431535009/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Worldserve International","ein":"431535009","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=16457&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/431535009"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15335&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1989, the mission of the St. Louis Public Library Foundation is to support the Library's programs and services through advocacy, fundraising and by building relationships with others who share a passion for the Library's work and to conduct a major capital campaign to support the renovation and modernization of Central Library–designed by American Architect Cass Gilbert and built in 1912.

As the crack cocaine epidemic gripped our community, the founders of the Coalition saw children languish for years in foster care. They believed in a different future, one in which no child grew up without the love and support of a family. Today, with 30 years of experience in system change and grassroots advocacy, combined with undiminished passion, their vision remains: \"For Every Child … A Place to Call Home.\" Recognized by the New York Times and TIME Magazine for its groundbreaking and data-driven work in foster care and adoption, The Coalition is our region's leader in responding to the opioid epidemic that currently threatens our most vulnerable children. To help create permanency in every child's life, The Coalition focuses on two areas: 1) finding and training more qualified; and 2) providing support to families so they can meet these children's elevated needs.","websiteURL":"http://www.foster-adopt.org","tagLine":"For Every Child . . .A Place to Call Home","charityName":"Foster & Adoptive Care Coalition","ein":"431570225","orgID":11501,"currentRating":{"score":94.37,"ratingID":149887,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":92.04,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":17,"causeName":"Children's and Family Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=17&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/children_family.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":3256513,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":5060084,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"September, 1991","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MO","city":"Saint Louis","postalCode":"63144","streetAddress1":"1750 South Brentwood Boulevard","streetAddress2":"Suite 210"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/431570225/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Foster & Adoptive Care Coalition","ein":"431570225","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11501&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/431570225"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=18618&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Heart of America Shakespeare Festival's mission is to make the works of Shakespeare and Shakespeare-inspired works accessible to a diverse audience through a free, professional, outdoor festival, and additional free and paid performances and educational programs.
