On an annual basis, Allied Arts-funded programs impact the lives of approximately one million people including the hospitalized, elderly, veterans, at-risk and low-income schoolchildren, and families. Just last year, Allied Arts member agencies provided more than 729,000 arts experiences for Oklahoma youth in the classroom as well as at afterschool sites, libraries, community centers and agency facilities. With Allied Arts funding, cultural nonprofits are in a position to offer community programming at no cost or very affordable rates to ensure heightened access to the arts.","websiteURL":"http://www.alliedartsokc.com/","tagLine":"Enriching Lives Through Advancement of the Arts","charityName":"Allied Arts","ein":"730804291","orgID":14039,"currentRating":{"score":86.14,"ratingID":147270,"publicationDate":"2019-11-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":80.4,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":4,"causeName":"Performing Arts","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/performing_arts.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":7197347,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":5111039,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"May, 1972","nteeCode":"A12","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Fund Raising and/or Fund Distribution","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"OK","city":"Oklahoma City","postalCode":"73102","streetAddress1":"1015 N Broadway","streetAddress2":"Suite 200"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/730804291/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Allied Arts","ein":"730804291","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14039&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/730804291"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9666&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"Tulsa Zoo Friends supports the Tulsa Zoo and Living Museum by providing admissions, attractions, food and beverage, marketing and fundraising services.
