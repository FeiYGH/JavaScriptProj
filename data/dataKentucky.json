Bernheim established Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest in 1929. Bernheim's mission is to strengthen the bond between people and nature by finding new ways to connect nature with people's everyday lives. We do this by providing ample opportunities for quiet, personal experiences with the outdoors; fostering curiosity and the love of learning with imaginative, inter-disciplinary, outdoor-oriented horticultural and natural history programs and exhibits, as well nature-inspired art and cultural activities; and by increasing understanding of the natural world through progressive, inter-disciplinary research in horticulture, natural areas management, and habitat restoration.","websiteURL":"http://www.bernheim.org","tagLine":"Connecting people with nature","charityName":"Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest","ein":"610444651","orgID":5597,"currentRating":{"score":88.89,"ratingID":143980,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":92.88,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":86,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Environment","categoryID":4,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/education.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":10,"causeName":"Botanical Gardens, Parks, and Nature Centers","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=4&cuid=10&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/botanical_gardens.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":54181792,"nteeType":"Environmental Quality, Protection and Beautification ","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":4951269,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"February, 2018","rulingDate":"May, 1930","nteeCode":"C36","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Forest Conservation","accountingPeriod":"February","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"C"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"KY","city":"Clermont","postalCode":"40110","streetAddress1":"2075 Clermont Road","streetAddress2":null},"donationAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"KY","city":"Clermont","postalCode":"40110","streetAddress1":"P.O.
