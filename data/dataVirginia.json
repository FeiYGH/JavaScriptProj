In addition, IJ trains law students, lawyers, policy activists and grassroots organizers in the tactics of public interest litigation and advocacy for liberty. Through these activities, IJ challenges the ideology of the welfare state and illustrates and extends the benefits of freedom to those whose full enjoyment of liberty is denied by government.","websiteURL":"http://www.ij.org","tagLine":"Litigating for liberty","charityName":"Institute for Justice","ein":"521744337","orgID":5454,"currentRating":{"score":97.19,"ratingID":147298,"publicationDate":"2019-11-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":97.4,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":97,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human and Civil Rights","categoryID":8,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=8&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/international.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":21,"causeName":"Advocacy and Education","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=8&cuid=21&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/advocacy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":null,"nteeType":"Civil Rights, Social Action, Advocacy","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":null,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"January, 1992","nteeCode":"R60","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Civil Liberties Advocacy","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"R"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"VA","city":"Arlington","postalCode":"22203","streetAddress1":"901 North Glebe Road","streetAddress2":"Suite 900"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521744337/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Institute for Justice","ein":"521744337","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5454&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521744337"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6564&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"Established in 1994, NatureServe is a conservation organization whose mission is to provide the scientific basis for effective conservation action.
