CAP advocates respect and compassion for all animal life - we speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.

To fulfill our mission, CAP has developed and established many successful programs and services to enhance the lives of pets and people in the Greater Houston Area and surrounding counties.

United Way was built on the belief that together, we can accomplish more than any individual or organization can accomplish alone. We work toward long term solutions in the areas of health, education and financial stability, believing these are the building blocks for a good life- a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health for a more productive life. Our vision is to create long-lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place.","websiteURL":"http://www.uwcb.org/","tagLine":"United We All Win","charityName":"United Way of the Coastal Bend","ein":"741207552","orgID":14845,"currentRating":{"score":99.2,"ratingID":142346,"publicationDate":"2019-06-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":98.87,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Community Development","categoryID":10,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=10&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/religion.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":42,"causeName":"United Ways","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=10&cuid=42&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/United_Way.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":6550924,"nteeType":"Philanthropy, Voluntarism and Grantmaking Foundations","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":6040695,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"January, 1953","nteeCode":"T70","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Fund Raising Organizations That Cross Categories","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"T"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"TX","city":"Corpus Christi","postalCode":"78411","streetAddress1":"4659 Everhart Rd","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/741207552/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"United Way of the Coastal Bend","ein":"741207552","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14845&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/741207552"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=3333&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","mission":"Established in 1961 as Laguna Gloria Art Museum, the Austin Museum of Art (AMOA) is dedicated to developing and educating a broad audience for the visual arts in Austin, focusing primarily on 20th-century and contemporary art.
