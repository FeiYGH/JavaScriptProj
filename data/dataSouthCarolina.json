Dining for Women chapters meet on a regular basis – most monthly – and share a meal together. It may be in someone's home, in a college cafeteria, an office break room, a church hall, or a local watering hole. Members share camaraderie and learn about that month's featured grantees through videos, educational documents and presentations, and free and open discussion. Funds raised each month go to fund the featured and sustained grantees, as well as support the entire mission of Dining for Women.","websiteURL":"http://diningforwomen.org/","tagLine":"Changing The World One Woman, One Girl, One Dinner At A Time","charityName":"Dining for Women","ein":"200031928","orgID":16725,"currentRating":{"score":87.45,"ratingID":150408,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":82.26,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"cause":{"causeID":20,"causeName":"Development and Relief Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=20&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/development_relief.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=9af5afa3"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":773412,"nteeType":"Philanthropy, Voluntarism and Grantmaking Foundations","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":2013167,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"July, 2004","nteeCode":"T20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Private Grantmaking Foundations","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"T"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"SC","city":"Greenville","postalCode":"29616","streetAddress1":"P.O.

Today, Haven of Rest is a Christ-centered ministry that provides hope, healing, and recovery for men and women facing life-dominating problems, such as homelessness and addiction.
