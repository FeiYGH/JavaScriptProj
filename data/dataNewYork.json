IPI was founded in 1970, by individuals who believed that a thoroughly independent institution, free from official constraints, could make a unique contribution to multilateral efforts to prevent and settle armed conflicts around the world. As a policy research institute, our core goal is to inform decision-makers in government and the UN of trends and dynamics in peace and security and provide them with realistic policy recommendations. We do so by generating policy-relevant research and by channeling expert advice from all over the world into the UN system.","websiteURL":"https://www.ipinst.org/","tagLine":"Managing risk and building resilience for a more peaceful and secure world","charityName":"International Peace Institute","ein":"030213226","orgID":3895,"currentRating":{"score":95.34,"ratingID":140116,"publicationDate":"2019-04-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":93.41,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":19,"causeName":"International Peace, Security, and Affairs","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=19&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/international_peace.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":11476509,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":8392525,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"May, 1956","nteeCode":"Q40","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"International Peace and Security","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10017    ","streetAddress1":"777 United Nations Plaza","streetAddress2":"4th Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/030213226/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"International Peace Institute","ein":"030213226","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=3895&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/030213226"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10943&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Our mission statement, educating to end the cycle of domestic violence and save lives, speaks to our commitment and focus to help children that are victims and witnesses of domestic violence to navigate a difficult path.
