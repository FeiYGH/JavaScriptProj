Since the opening of Brookfield Zoo in 1934, the Society has had an international reputation for taking a cutting-edge role in animal care and conservation of the natural world. Among its historical firsts are indoor multispecies exhibits, zoo nutrition residencies, methods for animal husbandry, and medical care that includes successful brain surgery for a gorilla. In building its legacy of animal care and compassion, the Society has launched a leadership campaign to create two new centers: the Center for Conservation Leadership and the Center for the Science of Animal Well-Being (CSAW).","websiteURL":"http://www.brookfieldzoo.org","tagLine":"Inspiring conservation leadership","charityName":"Chicago Zoological Society","ein":"362167016","orgID":3474,"currentRating":{"score":86.99,"ratingID":149124,"publicationDate":"2020-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":89.35,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":85,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Animals","categoryID":1,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=1&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/animals.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":32,"causeName":"Zoos and Aquariums","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=1&cuid=32&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/zoos_aquariums.jpg?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":209343000,"nteeType":"Animal-Related","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":90190097,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"September, 1941","nteeCode":"D50","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Zoo, Zoological Society","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"D"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"IL","city":"Brookfield","postalCode":"60513    ","streetAddress1":"3300 Golf Road","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/362167016/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Chicago Zoological Society","ein":"362167016","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=3474&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/362167016"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=18388&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Youth Guidance creates and implements school-based programs that enable children to overcome obstacles, focus on their education and, ultimately, to succeed in school and in life.

We offer to people of goodwill the opportunity to join the elderly in friendship and celebration of life. Programs offered by LBFE Chicago include visiting programs, social opportunities, holiday celebrations, vacation programs and inter generational programs, among others. In FY2019 we served 1,148 elders, with the support of 1,700 volunteers who gave more than 30,000 hours of their time. Together we provide friendship to those who are aging without the support of family or friends. More than half the seniors we serve could not count on having two personal conversations in a month without our involvement in their lives.
