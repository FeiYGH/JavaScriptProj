We have granted over 7,000 wishes since our inception in 1983. No child should ever have to endure the struggle and pain that come with battling a life-threatening illness. Giving back to these children, what their illness has taken away - laughter, strength, hope and joy, is our sole purpose at the Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Jersey. The New Jersey Chapter serves the entire state of New Jersey.","websiteURL":"http://nj.wish.org","tagLine":"Share the power of a wish","charityName":"Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Jersey","ein":"222488495","orgID":6794,"currentRating":{"score":88.68,"ratingID":147882,"publicationDate":"2019-12-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":84.28,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":97,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Health","categoryID":5,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/environment.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":34,"causeName":"Patient and Family Support","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=5&cuid=34&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/patient_and_family_support.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":20295708,"nteeType":"Health - General and Rehabilitative","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":11847417,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"August, 2018","rulingDate":"October, 1985","nteeCode":"E86","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Patient Services - Entertainment, Recreation","accountingPeriod":"August","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"E"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NJ","city":"Monroe Township","postalCode":"08831","streetAddress1":"1347 Perrineville Road","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/222488495/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Jersey","ein":"222488495","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6794&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/222488495"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8532&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Homeless Solutions, Inc. was founded in 1983 as Morris Shelter, Inc.

We operate a community soup kitchen, culinary arts school, catering business, pay-as-you-can café, and connect low-income individuals and families with social and health services. We fight to end hunger through promoting good food for all, providing education and jobs in the food industry, and creating social enterprise food businesses that create social good. We envision a community where no one goes hungry for lack of food or funds; where a good meal is a nutritious meal; where our community learns to steward natural and financial resources wisely; and where we make opportunity available to those who seek.","websiteURL":"http://www.elijahspromise.org","tagLine":"Food Changes Lives","charityName":"Elijah's Promise","ein":"223055539","orgID":11794,"currentRating":{"score":86.84,"ratingID":149913,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":85,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":29,"causeName":"Social Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=29&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/social_services.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":2225180,"nteeType":"Food, Agriculture and Nutrition","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":2295677,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"March, 1991","nteeCode":"K30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Food Service, Free Food Distribution Programs","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"K"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NJ","city":"New Brunswick","postalCode":"08901","streetAddress1":"211 Livingston Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/223055539/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Elijah's Promise","ein":"223055539","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11794&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/223055539"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14224&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"nourish.NJ creates lasting solutions to the problems of hunger, homelessness and poverty.
