Founded in 1970, St. Petersburg Free Clinic began as a single walk-in medical facility that provided basic health care services to those without health insurance and those without the means to provide adequate health care for themselves and their families - primarily those who fall through the cracks of existing systems and services. In subsequent years, as additional needs of the community have been identified, we have expanded our services, becoming a multi-service, multi-site agency to address the need for food, shelter and health care through our eight essential programs: Health Center, Dental Clinic, Food Bank, We Help Services, Community Kitchen, Beacon House (homeless men's shelter), Women's Residence (homeless women's shelter) and Family Residence (homeless shelter).

Since 2006, The NASCAR Foundation has committed more than $25 Million dollars to initiatives that inspire children around the country to live, learn and play. Evidence of our impact can be found on the smiles of thousands of children attending summer camp for the first time, receiving care in our Speediatrics hospital units and exploring the behind-the-scenes world of NASCAR during race weekends. It can also be found through the Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award which honors the spirit of volunteerism that drives the NASCAR community.","websiteURL":"http://www.nascarfoundation.org/","tagLine":"Every child deserves a champion","charityName":"The NASCAR Foundation","ein":"300337745","orgID":13851,"currentRating":{"score":84.31,"ratingID":151234,"publicationDate":"2020-04-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":77.82,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":37,"causeName":"Scholarship and Financial Support","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=37&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/scholarships.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":3168155,"nteeType":"Philanthropy, Voluntarism and Grantmaking Foundations","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":4031974,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"October, 2005","nteeCode":"T30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Public Foundations","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"T"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"FL","city":"Daytona Beach","postalCode":"32114","streetAddress1":"One Daytona Boulevard","streetAddress2":"Seventh Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/300337745/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"The NASCAR Foundation","ein":"300337745","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13851&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/300337745"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17939&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Boca Helping Hands (BHH) mission is to provide food, medical, and financial assistance to meet basic human needs as well as education, job training, and guidance to create self-sufficiency.
