ILAP has grown as new immigrant communities have come to Maine and have moved to new areas of the state, and as our immigration laws and policies have become more complex and more difficult to navigate without an attorney. ILAP now has offices in Portland and Lewiston and a bimonthly presence in Milbridge. Increased use of technology, volunteers, and education and outreach help ILAP reach more immigrants throughout the state. Each year, ILAP attorneys and legal staff and more than 250 volunteers provide legal assistance to over 3,000 clients, and conduct education and outreach on immigration law issues for about 1,700 people.","websiteURL":"http://www.ilapmaine.org","tagLine":"Fighting for the rights of Maine's immigrants","charityName":"Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project","ein":"223260883","orgID":18441,"currentRating":{"score":92.02,"ratingID":150935,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":88.72,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human and Civil Rights","categoryID":8,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=8&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/international.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":21,"causeName":"Advocacy and Education","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=8&cuid=21&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/advocacy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1247545,"nteeType":"Crime, Legal-Related","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":1405487,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"November, 1993","nteeCode":"I80","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Legal Services","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"I"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"ME","city":"Portland","postalCode":"04112","streetAddress1":"489 Congress Street","streetAddress2":"Third Floor"},"donationAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"ME","city":"Portland","postalCode":"04112","streetAddress1":"PO Box 17917","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/223260883/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project","ein":"223260883","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=18441&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/223260883"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6840&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Animal Welfare Society, incorporated in 1967, is a private humane society and regional leader in companion animal welfare. <br><br>AWS operates a progressive animal shelter and adoption center on a 40 acre campus in West Kennebunk and satellite adoption centers throughout northern New England.
