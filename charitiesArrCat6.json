Committed to affecting positive change, the YMCA has been recognized for its efforts in the areas of character development, teen programs, homelessness, neighborhood revitalization, international partnerships and summer camps.","websiteURL":"http://www.ymcaofcm.org/","tagLine":"We build strong kids, strong families, strong communities","charityName":"YMCA of Central Massachusetts","ein":"042105885","orgID":7531,"currentRating":{"score":91.39,"ratingID":146524,"publicationDate":"2019-10-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":94.78,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":15,"causeName":"Multipurpose Human Service Organizations","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=15&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/multipurpose.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":57017803,"nteeType":"Human Services - Multipurpose and Other","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":29060165,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"September, 2018","rulingDate":"March, 1934","nteeCode":"P27","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":"Young Men's or Women's Associations (YMCA, YWCA, YWHA, YMHA)","accountingPeriod":"September","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"P"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MA","city":"Worcester","postalCode":"01610","streetAddress1":"766 Main Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/042105885/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"YMCA of Central Massachusetts","ein":"042105885","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7531&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/042105885"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7945&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Carroll Center for the Blind serves the needs of blind and visually-impaired persons by providing rehabilitation, skills training, and educational opportunities to achieve independence, self-sufficiency, and self-fulfillment and by educating the public regarding the potential of persons who are blind and visually-impaired.

While New York State is spending over $350,000 per year to incarcerate a youth, and realizing a 75% reincarceration rate for their efforts, we are able to dramatically reduce the reincarceration rate for our successful clients to 10% and we do so at a cost of only $4,300 per juvenile.

Like many other caring New York City residents, they searched in vain for an organization that offered hands-on volunteer opportunities that had a marked impact on the community and fit around their busy schedules. In response, they created New York Cares to address the problems from the ground up. Our mission: to meet pressing community needs by mobilizing caring New Yorkers in volunteer service. Today, New York Cares is the city's leading volunteer management organization. Our programs address urban poverty, with three overarching goals: (1) to meet immediate needs, such as providing meals to the hungry, (2) to improve educational outcomes for NYC students and adults, and 3) revitalize NYC's invaluable public spaces. This year, New York Cares will engage 64,000 volunteers on projects that will help 400,000 at-risk New Yorkers.

Special Olympics Georgia invests in people with intellectual disabilities, helping them to develop athletic skills, while also promoting the abilities of the athletes off the field.","websiteURL":"http://www.specialolympicsga.org/","tagLine":"Be a fan","charityName":"Special Olympics Georgia","ein":"237201676","orgID":8774,"currentRating":{"score":91.28,"ratingID":147461,"publicationDate":"2020-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":88.05,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":97,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":15,"causeName":"Multipurpose Human Service Organizations","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=15&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/multipurpose.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":19609789,"nteeType":"Recreation, Sports, Leisure, Athletics","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":7822182,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"March, 1977","nteeCode":"N72","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Special Olympics","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"N"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"GA","city":"Norcross","postalCode":"30071","streetAddress1":"6046 Financial Drive","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/237201676/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Special Olympics Georgia","ein":"237201676","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8774&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/237201676"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8741&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Meals on Wheels Central Texas seeks to nourish and enrich the lives of the homebound and other people in need through programs that promote dignity and independent living.

Domestic violence has been ongoing throughout the ages, all over the world; it wasn't until the early 1970s that domestic violence was even given a name and recognized as a national problem.","websiteURL":"http://www.wcspittsburgh.org","tagLine":"Working to end intimate partner violence in the lives of women and their children","charityName":"Women's Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh","ein":"251264376","orgID":12151,"currentRating":{"score":94.69,"ratingID":149949,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":92.5,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":29,"causeName":"Social Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=29&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/social_services.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":29630256,"nteeType":"Human Services - Multipurpose and Other","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":11445297,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"October, 1976","nteeCode":"P43","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Family Violence Shelters, Services","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"P"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"PA","city":"Pittsburgh","postalCode":"15224","streetAddress1":"P.O.

The IYI's programs are offered for free or very low cost, allowing youth organizations that are often on tight budgets to save money that can be used instead for their services to youth.","websiteURL":"http://www.iyi.org","tagLine":"Serving those who impact youth","charityName":"The Indiana Youth Institute","ein":"311251680","orgID":12859,"currentRating":{"score":87.35,"ratingID":142128,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":85.9,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":16,"causeName":"Youth Development, Shelter, and Crisis Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=16&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/youth_development.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":8831674,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":"E","incomeAmount":4135787,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"December, 1988","nteeCode":"P34","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organizations operated solely for the benefit of and in conjunction with organizations described in 10 through 16 above.  509(a)(3)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"P"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"IN","city":"Indianapolis","postalCode":"46204","streetAddress1":"603 East Washington Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 800"},"donationAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"IN","city":"Indianapolis","postalCode":"46206","streetAddress1":"PO Box 751","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/311251680/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"The Indiana Youth Institute","ein":"311251680","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=12859&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/311251680"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15253&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1982, Valley Interfaith Community Resource Center (VICRC) is the preeminent volunteer organization in the upper Millcreek Valley, dedicated to helping the less fortunate in our Hamilton County area.

Their choice of the word guest has been the underpinning of their entire philosophy, which is one of loving service and the belief that everyone has value and no one is a lost cause.","websiteURL":"http://www.brotherbenno.org","tagLine":"Uplifting the dignity of those we serve","charityName":"The Brother Benno Foundation","ein":"330051575","orgID":10226,"currentRating":{"score":96.46,"ratingID":147008,"publicationDate":"2019-10-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":95,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":29,"causeName":"Social Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=29&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/social_services.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":3989836,"nteeType":"Food, Agriculture and Nutrition","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":4917310,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"July, 2018","rulingDate":"December, 1984","nteeCode":"K30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Food Service, Free Food Distribution Programs","accountingPeriod":"July","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"K"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CA","city":"Oceanside ","postalCode":"92058","streetAddress1":"3260 Production Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/330051575/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"The Brother Benno Foundation","ein":"330051575","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10226&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/330051575"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9971&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1985, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Orange County serves children who, for their own protection, have been removed from their homes and placed in foster care.

With more than 10,000 members, we serve an estimated 20,000 people in our community each year.","websiteURL":"http://www.mcgawymca.org","tagLine":"We build strong kids, strong families, strong communities","charityName":"The McGaw YMCA","ein":"362169194","orgID":12712,"currentRating":{"score":89.73,"ratingID":144673,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":87.88,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":92,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":15,"causeName":"Multipurpose Human Service Organizations","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=15&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/multipurpose.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":20615443,"nteeType":"Human Services - Multipurpose and Other","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":4558328,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"August, 2018","rulingDate":"June, 1946","nteeCode":"P27","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":"Young Men's or Women's Associations (YMCA, YWCA, YWHA, YMHA)","accountingPeriod":"August","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"P"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"IL","city":"Evanston","postalCode":"60201","streetAddress1":"1000 Grove Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/362169194/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"The McGaw YMCA","ein":"362169194","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=12712&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/362169194"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9482&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Greater Joliet Area YMCA is a charitable organization that has been serving Will County and its surrounding areas for more than 84 years.

The founders were local clergy, businesspeople, and community leaders. They were concerned about low income people not having emergency access to the basic necessities of life, not knowing where to turn for help, and the number of individuals who were going from place to place (particularly to churches) seeking assistance. Duplications of effort, and the real possibility of a few taking advantage of the charity of others, were also of great concern. The agency began with a tiny budget, a few volunteers, and a very part-time staff person. Since 1987, the agency has grown in budget, staff, and number of volunteers. There are currently over 200 volunteers that donate over 17,000 hours each year. This is equivalent to 8.3 full time employees and 67% of all hours worked.

Our network includes more than 620 not-for-profit agencies throughout our 26-county service area, including emergency food pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, children's homes, homes for the mentally disabled and shelters for battered persons.","websiteURL":"http://www.harvesters.org","tagLine":"Regional food bank serving Kansas City, Topeka and the surrounding area","charityName":"Harvesters: The Community Food Network","ein":"431208665","orgID":3797,"currentRating":{"score":90.98,"ratingID":141326,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":87.89,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":18,"causeName":"Food Banks, Food Pantries, and Food Distribution","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=18&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/food_banks.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":30454365,"nteeType":"Food, Agriculture and Nutrition","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":103518319,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"May, 1980","nteeCode":"K30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Food Service, Free Food Distribution Programs","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"K"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MO","city":"Kansas City","postalCode":"64129","streetAddress1":"3801 Topping Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/431208665/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Harvesters: The Community Food Network","ein":"431208665","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=3797&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/431208665"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7043&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"For 40 years, Boys Hope Girls Hope has been helping scholars rise up from disadvantaged backgrounds and strive for more.

As the crack cocaine epidemic gripped our community, the founders of the Coalition saw children languish for years in foster care. They believed in a different future, one in which no child grew up without the love and support of a family. Today, with 30 years of experience in system change and grassroots advocacy, combined with undiminished passion, their vision remains: \"For Every Child … A Place to Call Home.\" Recognized by the New York Times and TIME Magazine for its groundbreaking and data-driven work in foster care and adoption, The Coalition is our region's leader in responding to the opioid epidemic that currently threatens our most vulnerable children. To help create permanency in every child's life, The Coalition focuses on two areas: 1) finding and training more qualified; and 2) providing support to families so they can meet these children's elevated needs.","websiteURL":"http://www.foster-adopt.org","tagLine":"For Every Child . . .A Place to Call Home","charityName":"Foster & Adoptive Care Coalition","ein":"431570225","orgID":11501,"currentRating":{"score":94.37,"ratingID":149887,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":92.04,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":17,"causeName":"Children's and Family Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=17&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/children_family.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":3256513,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":5060084,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"September, 1991","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MO","city":"Saint Louis","postalCode":"63144","streetAddress1":"1750 South Brentwood Boulevard","streetAddress2":"Suite 210"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/431570225/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Foster & Adoptive Care Coalition","ein":"431570225","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11501&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/431570225"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17429&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Coyote Hill Christian Children's Home's target population is abused and neglected children between the ages of 6 and 14 upon placement.

Our vision is a community where every child is nurtured, supported and has access to connections and resources necessary for them to know their value and reach their full potential.","websiteURL":"https://stlcasa.org/","tagLine":"Speaking up for kids in foster care","charityName":"CASA of St. Louis","ein":"431807059","orgID":16458,"currentRating":{"score":82.68,"ratingID":140954,"publicationDate":"2019-06-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":75.51,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":17,"causeName":"Children's and Family Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=17&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/children_family.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1664877,"nteeType":"Civil Rights, Social Action, Advocacy","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":2487252,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"June, 1998","nteeCode":"R20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Civil Rights, Advocacy for Specific Groups","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"R"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MO","city":"St. Louis","postalCode":"63105","streetAddress1":"105 South Central Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"donationAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MO","city":"St. Louis","postalCode":"63105","streetAddress1":"P.O.
