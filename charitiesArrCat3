STUDIO provides programs to more than 170 schools throughout the five boroughs annually.","websiteURL":"http://www.studioinaschool.org","tagLine":"Fostering the creative and intellectual development of young people through quality visual arts programs","charityName":"Studio in a School","ein":"133003112","orgID":4971,"currentRating":{"score":92.07,"ratingID":146463,"publicationDate":"2019-10-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":92.15,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":92,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":40,"causeName":"Youth Education Programs and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=40&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/youth_education.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":20673487,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":8431453,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"February, 1980","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10023","streetAddress1":"75 West End Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133003112/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Studio in a School","ein":"133003112","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=4971&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133003112"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=3257&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Shalom Hartman Institute (SHI) is a center of transformative thinking and teaching that addresses the major challenges facing the Jewish people and elevates the quality of Jewish life in Israel and around the world.

In addition, through its Garden of Dreams Giving program, the Foundation helps its partner organizations meet the critical needs of the children they serve, including through direct support of scholarships and tangible, targeted community projects.","websiteURL":"http://gardenofdreamsfoundation.org/","tagLine":"Using the magic of Madison Square Garden to brighten the lives of children and their families","charityName":"Garden of Dreams Foundation","ein":"133979726","orgID":15640,"currentRating":{"score":83.91,"ratingID":144866,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":87.5,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":81,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":37,"causeName":"Scholarship and Financial Support","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=37&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/scholarships.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":5125487,"nteeType":"Philanthropy, Voluntarism and Grantmaking Foundations","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":7667516,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"August, 2018","rulingDate":"August, 1998","nteeCode":"T30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Public Foundations","accountingPeriod":"August","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"T"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10121","streetAddress1":"2 Penn Plaza","streetAddress2":"14th Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133979726/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Garden of Dreams Foundation","ein":"133979726","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15640&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133979726"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=4531&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"At the Children's Scholarship Fund (CSF), we believe a quality elementary school education puts children on the path to success in life.

These CSF Scholars live close to/below the federal poverty line yet their families are all paying at least 25 percent of their tuition each year.

While still providing technical assistance in implementing the Academy Model, PAI has now created a more diverse portfolio of career-connected services offered outside the Academy framework that provide varying levels of engagement and structure: Work-Based Learning, Career Pathways and Pre-Apprenticeship Programs. <br><br>PAI envisions a world where all young people have the skills, resources and networks to reach their full potential.","websiteURL":"http://www.academiesinc.org","tagLine":"Connecting students to industry and industry to schools","charityName":"Philadelphia Academies Inc.","ein":"222442433","orgID":17321,"currentRating":{"score":82.09,"ratingID":142613,"publicationDate":"2019-06-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":75,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":41,"causeName":"Education Policy and Reform","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=41&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/education_policy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":679161,"nteeType":"Educational Institutions and Related Activities","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":1707585,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"May, 1983","nteeCode":"B30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Vocational, Technical Schools","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"B"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"PA","city":"Philadelphia","postalCode":"19102","streetAddress1":"1401 Walnut Street","streetAddress2":"9th Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/222442433/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Philadelphia Academies Inc.","ein":"222442433","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17321&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/222442433"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15236&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Community Preparatory School serves culturally and economically diverse students who are well qualified to benefit from a rigorous academic education in an atmosphere of mutual respect, especially students who would otherwise not have access to such an education.

All of these programs take place on premises within local school environments.","websiteURL":"https://newteachercenter.org/","tagLine":"A New Generation of Educators","charityName":"New Teacher Center","ein":"262427526","orgID":17116,"currentRating":{"score":87,"ratingID":145946,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":85.28,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":41,"causeName":"Education Policy and Reform","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=41&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/education_policy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":24005812,"nteeType":"Educational Institutions and Related Activities","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":35761397,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"August, 2008","nteeCode":"B90","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Educational Services and Schools - Other","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"B"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CA","city":"Santa Cruz","postalCode":"95060","streetAddress1":"110 Cooper Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 500"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/262427526/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"New Teacher Center","ein":"262427526","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17116&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/262427526"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17195&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The mission of Teach Plus is to empower excellent, experienced teachers to take leadership over key policy and practice issues that affect their students' success.

We motivate students to stay in school and pursue college, advise students and parents how to apply to college and access financial aid, fund students with Last Dollar Grant and leverage additional financial assistance, and support students once in college to help ensure completion.","websiteURL":"http://www.iknowican.org/","tagLine":"Helping Columbus City school students enter and succeed in college","charityName":"I Know I Can","ein":"311229135","orgID":7803,"currentRating":{"score":95,"ratingID":147440,"publicationDate":"2019-11-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":99,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":93,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":37,"causeName":"Scholarship and Financial Support","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=37&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/scholarships.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":39424579,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":7378564,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"April, 1988","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"OH","city":"Columbus","postalCode":"43206","streetAddress1":"1108 City Park Avenue","streetAddress2":"Suite 301"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/311229135/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"I Know I Can","ein":"311229135","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7803&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/311229135"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13079&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Uncommon Schools (Uncommon) starts and manages outstanding urban charter public schools that close the achievement gap and prepare low-income students to graduate from college.

Deciding to explore this need further, Mary Jan found that most of the childcare centers serving economically-disadvantaged children had few to zero quality books for young children. That same year, Mary Jan founded Make Way for Books (MWFB) to meet this incredible need and began providing books to under-resourced sites and offering early literacy workshops for educators and parents. Today, MWFB has provided services to nearly 300 preschools and childcare centers.

Because of the success of the first school in Dallas, this school model is being replicated throughout the state, as a catalyst for positive educational change.","websiteURL":"http://youngwomensprep.org/","tagLine":"Educating future leaders","charityName":"Young Women's Preparatory Network","ein":"470902114","orgID":17416,"currentRating":{"score":90.6,"ratingID":141020,"publicationDate":"2019-05-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":92.54,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":40,"causeName":"Youth Education Programs and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=40&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/youth_education.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":6679242,"nteeType":"Educational Institutions and Related Activities","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":8570296,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"February, 2004","nteeCode":"B90","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Educational Services and Schools - Other","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"B"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"TX","city":"Dallas","postalCode":"75204","streetAddress1":"2804 Swiss Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/470902114/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Young Women's Preparatory Network","ein":"470902114","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17416&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/470902114"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=16683&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation's mission is to provide college scholarships and educational counseling to military children who have lost a parent in the line of duty.

When more than a century ago a Harvard physician claimed that higher education jeopardized women's health, AAUW conducted research that proved he was wrong. When the number of female college students grew, AAUW funded fellowships to support them. When girls and boys were treated differently in school, AAUW research put gender bias on the national agenda. When women receive less pay than their male colleagues for the same job, AAUW continues researching, educating, and advocating for equity.\r\n\r\n","websiteURL":"http://www.aauw.org","tagLine":"Empowering Women Since 1881","charityName":"AAUW - American Association of University Women","ein":"526037388","orgID":3240,"currentRating":{"score":85.88,"ratingID":142987,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":80.04,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":40,"causeName":"Youth Education Programs and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=40&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/youth_education.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":131723362,"nteeType":"Educational Institutions and Related Activities","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":147282444,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"March, 2010","nteeCode":"B82","groupName":"AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN INC                          ","deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Central - the organization is a parent (group ruling) and is not a church or 501(c)(1) organization.","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Scholarships, Student Financial Aid Services, Awards","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"B"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"DC","city":"Washington","postalCode":"20005","streetAddress1":"1310 L Street NW, Suite 1000","streetAddress2":null},"donationAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"DC","city":" Washington","postalCode":"20090","streetAddress1":"AAUW","streetAddress2":"P.O.

The fact that Small Steps students graduate from kindergarten on par with their peers means our approach is working.","websiteURL":"http://ssnc.org","tagLine":"Hope for children straight from the heart","charityName":"Small Steps Nurturing Center","ein":"760471755","orgID":8255,"currentRating":{"score":91.64,"ratingID":144425,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":88.19,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":36,"causeName":"Early Childhood Programs and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=36&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/early_childhood.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":5798755,"nteeType":"Educational Institutions and Related Activities","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":3854027,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"September, 1995","nteeCode":"B92","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Remedial Reading, Reading Encouragement","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"B"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"TX","city":"Houston","postalCode":"77007","streetAddress1":"1709 DePelchin Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/760471755/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Small Steps Nurturing Center","ein":"760471755","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8255&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/760471755"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=3476&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The mission of The Houston A+ Challenge is to promote an academically rich and purposeful education for more of our children and to demonstrate how such an education could become possible for all our children.

Our vision is that all children will have access to public schools that prepare them for success in life. We focus on authorizers, the legal entities doing the work of authorizing. They decide who can start a new charter school, set expectations and oversee school performance, and decide which schools should continue to serve students or not. Depending on state law, authorizers can be school districts, education agencies, independent boards, universities, mayors and municipalities, and not-for-profits. Over 1,000 authorizers in 44 states (43 plus the District of Columbia) with charter laws are on the forefront of creating the next generation of public schools, helping translate charter school ideas into solid realities for millions of children. The schools they oversee are both more nimble and more accountable, built on the premise that it is a privilege to educate America's children. Since its founding, NACSA has grown into an organization with 30 staff and 175 member organizations representing more than 1,200 professionals.","websiteURL":"http://www.qualitycharters.org/","tagLine":"Improving quality educational opportunities for children by strengthening charter school authorizing","charityName":"National Association of Charter School Authorizers","ein":"841553195","orgID":17178,"currentRating":{"score":85,"ratingID":142582,"publicationDate":"2019-06-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":85,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":85,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":41,"causeName":"Education Policy and Reform","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=41&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/education_policy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":5233528,"nteeType":"Educational Institutions and Related Activities","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":4642765,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"November, 2001","nteeCode":"B02","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Management & Technical Assistance ","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"B"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"IL","city":"Chicago","postalCode":"60603","streetAddress1":"105 West Adams Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 1900"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/841553195/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"National Association of Charter School Authorizers","ein":"841553195","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=17178&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/841553195"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10989&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Point Foundation empowers promising lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) students to achieve their full academic and leadership potential - despite the obstacles often put before them - to make a significant impact on society.

The mission of IHS is to support the achievement of a freer society by discovering and facilitating the development of talented, productive students, scholars, and other intellectuals who share an interest in liberty and who demonstrate the potential to help change the current climate of opinion to one more congenial to the principles and practice of freedom.","websiteURL":"http://www.theihs.org/","tagLine":"Explore the ideas of liberty","charityName":"Institute for Humane Studies","ein":"941623852","orgID":7916,"currentRating":{"score":84.49,"ratingID":145357,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":84,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":85,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Education","categoryID":3,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/community-development.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":40,"causeName":"Youth Education Programs and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=3&cuid=40&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/youth_education.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":9848348,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":19754147,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"August, 2018","rulingDate":"June, 1965","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"August","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"VA","city":"Arlington","postalCode":"22201","streetAddress1":"3301 North Fairfax Drive","streetAddress2":"Suite 440"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/941623852/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Institute for Humane Studies","ein":"941623852","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7916&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/941623852"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8549&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Weingarten Children's Center (formerly Jean Weingarten Peninsula Oral School for the Deaf and currently legally incorporated as the Foundation for Hearing Research)) is a not-for-profit, state accredited non-public school teaching children with hearing loss to listen, think and talk through intensive speech/language therapy and the development of listening skills.
