The APL's Humane Investigations team investigates reports of animal cruelty in Cuyahoga County and assists with the prosecution of those cases. The APL provides shelter to animals that have been relinquished by their guardians or rescued by the APL from abuse or neglect, and to stray or abandoned cats. It has achieved 100 percent placement of healthy, friendly animals. The APL also provides veterinary care to sick or injured animals that are admitted into our shelter, can be safely and humanely treated, rehabilitated in foster homes, and then placed into loving homes. The APL offers outreach programs in the community that reduce the birthrate of unwanted litters of cats and dogs and provide resources and support to pet owners in targeted, under-served areas.

To fulfill the promise of animals, the Capital Humane Society shelters animals, protects animals and teaches compassion and respect.","websiteURL":"http://www.capitalhumanesociety.org","tagLine":"Make a friend for life","charityName":"Capital Humane Society","ein":"470376622","orgID":7053,"currentRating":{"score":87.57,"ratingID":147896,"publicationDate":"2019-12-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":86.3,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Animals","categoryID":1,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=1&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/animals.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":2,"causeName":"Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=1&cuid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/animal_rights.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":9809071,"nteeType":"Animal-Related","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":3448449,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Organization to Prevent Cruelty to Animals","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"April, 1941","nteeCode":"D20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Animal Protection and Welfare","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"D"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NE","city":"Lincoln","postalCode":"68502","streetAddress1":"2320 Park Boulevard","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/470376622/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Capital Humane Society","ein":"470376622","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7053&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/470376622"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=4212&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Nebraska Humane Society (NHS), founded in 1875, is the fifth oldest humane society in the U.S. and one of the largest.

They include a pet adoption center; wildlife and farm animal sanctuary; animal rescues and veterinary care; rehabilitation of abused, neglected and abandoned animals; low cost spay/neuter program; grief counseling; and humane education.","websiteURL":"http://www.adopt-a-pet.org/","tagLine":"The scales of justice must be equal for all God's creatures","charityName":"Defenders of Animal Rights","ein":"521061126","orgID":7085,"currentRating":{"score":83.67,"ratingID":149081,"publicationDate":"2020-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":93.02,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":78,"rating":2}},"category":{"categoryName":"Animals","categoryID":1,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=1&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/animals.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":2,"causeName":"Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=1&cuid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/animal_rights.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":9198598,"nteeType":"Animal-Related","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":1841964,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Organization to Prevent Cruelty to Animals","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"October, 1976","nteeCode":"D20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Animal Protection and Welfare","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"D"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MD","city":"Phoenix","postalCode":"21131","streetAddress1":"14412 Old York Road","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521061126/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Defenders of Animal Rights","ein":"521061126","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7085&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521061126"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6216&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International is dedicated to the conservation, protection and study of gorillas and their habitats in Africa.

Last year, we cared for 4,119 pets and 95% of the pets went to new or existing homes. We are a 501c3, as well as a No Kill Humane Society, where we firmly believe that no healthy or treatable pet should be euthanized. By operating the public shelter for the City of Lynchburg, and Appomattox, we accept the stray or unwanted pets surrendered to us from those communities. We also have developed a more regional/state level focus. In 2017 we helped 638 pets from other public shelters that otherwise may have had a negative outcome.

In the meantime, though, animals were and still are dying at rate of around 30,000 per year in our local shelters with even more just dying in the streets. Therefore, we decided to refocus our efforts slightly away from rescue and more toward promoting spay/neuter as the solution to the tragic pet overpopulation problem here in Las Vegas. On June 19, 2009 Heaven Can Wait took a giant leap forward by opening a high-volume/high-quality, low-cost/no-cost spay/neuter clinic near Eastern & 95. This clinic will serve as a much-needed resource for those who aren't able to afford sterilization services at regular veterinary prices.

Part of this success is the extraordinary medical and behavior services animals receive to ensure they are attractive candidates to adoptive families.","websiteURL":"http://www.whs4pets.org/","tagLine":"Providing compassionate services to pets and people","charityName":"Willamette Humane Society","ein":"930577975","orgID":5779,"currentRating":{"score":91.06,"ratingID":141489,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":88.02,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Animals","categoryID":1,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=1&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/animals.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":2,"causeName":"Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=1&cuid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/animal_rights.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":7541934,"nteeType":"Animal-Related","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":3256471,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Organization to Prevent Cruelty to Animals","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"September, 1966","nteeCode":"D20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":"Animal Protection and Welfare","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"D"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"OR","city":"Salem","postalCode":"97317","streetAddress1":"4246 Turner Road, SE","streetAddress2":null},"donationAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"OR","city":"Salem","postalCode":"97309","streetAddress1":"P.O.

Today, nearly 100 staff and 700 volunteers care for nearly 8,000 animals each year and assist all of Marin's residents with their animal needs.","websiteURL":"http://www.marinhumanesociety.org","tagLine":"We improve the lives of animals and people through advocacy, education, and support","charityName":"The Marin Humane Society","ein":"941156562","orgID":8395,"currentRating":{"score":92.8,"ratingID":141714,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":90.64,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Animals","categoryID":1,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=1&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/animals.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":2,"causeName":"Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=1&cuid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/animal_rights.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":18378309,"nteeType":"Animal-Related","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":10366098,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"December, 1950","nteeCode":"D20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":"Animal Protection and Welfare","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"D"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CA","city":"Novato","postalCode":"94949","streetAddress1":"171 Bel Marin Keys Boulevard","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/941156562/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"The Marin Humane Society","ein":"941156562","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8395&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/941156562"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=4475&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1905, The SPCA for Monterey County's doors are open to all animals in need, including dogs, cats, small animals, barn animals, exotic animals, and wildlife.

We know that bringing people face-to-face with living marine animals is a powerful way to move them to care about the oceans and ocean life. From the beginning, we planned our permanent exhibits as a walk through Monterey Bay's beautiful natural communities. In 1996, we almost doubled our exhibit space with the opening of the Outer Bay Wing, devoted to the open ocean and deep sea.

Our mission - promoting the human-animal bond and the humane treatment of all animals - is a joyful one full of challenges and opportunities. Throughout its history, the Society has focused on supporting both the people and the animals of our community; educating children and adults, helping to keep pets with their human families, reducing pet overpopulation through spay/neuter and working to find solutions to the challenges of a diverse society. With an open-door policy that welcomes all animals, the Hawaiian Humane Society operates 365 days a year. Centered in the heart of Honolulu, Hawaiian Humane is an animal shelter, a rescue operation, the official pet lost and found for Oahu, a pet adoption agency, an educational and advocacy organization and a pet care resource center.","websiteURL":"http://www.hawaiianhumane.org","tagLine":"Promoting the human-animal bond and the humane treatment of all animals","charityName":"Hawaiian Humane Society","ein":"990073490","orgID":5894,"currentRating":{"score":97.25,"ratingID":149332,"publicationDate":"2020-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":96.12,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Animals","categoryID":1,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=1&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/animals.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":2,"causeName":"Animal Rights, Welfare, and Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=1&cuid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/animal_rights.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":44799187,"nteeType":"Animal-Related","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":30785125,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"August, 1943","nteeCode":"D20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":"Animal Protection and Welfare","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"D"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"HI","city":"Honolulu","postalCode":"96826","streetAddress1":"2700 Waialae Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/990073490/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Hawaiian Humane Society","ein":"990073490","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5894&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/990073490"}}}}]
