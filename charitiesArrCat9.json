All are welcome to join us, knowing that in embracing the Christopher mission they will share one overriding commitment: the love of all people for the love of God.","websiteURL":"http://www.christophers.org","tagLine":"It's better to light one candle than to curse the darkness","charityName":"The Christophers","ein":"131809274","orgID":4532,"currentRating":{"score":85.58,"ratingID":141375,"publicationDate":"2019-06-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":92.62,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":81,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Religion","categoryID":9,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=9&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/public.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":25,"causeName":"Religious Media and Broadcasting","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=9&cuid=25&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/religious_media.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":6187441,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":2612163,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"March, 1946","nteeCode":null,"groupName":"UNITED STATES CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS                          ","deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Subordinate - the organization is a subordinate in a group ruling.","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10004","streetAddress1":"Five Hanover Square","streetAddress2":"Eleventh Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/131809274/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"The Christophers","ein":"131809274","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=4532&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/131809274"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14086&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Alpha USA is at a unique position in its history.

We use Christian radio, youth programming, adult services, personal counseling, and the performing arts as ways of talking to people about Christ.","websiteURL":"http://www.fln.org","tagLine":"Spreading the Gospel of Christ","charityName":"Family Life Ministries","ein":"160863914","orgID":9219,"currentRating":{"score":95.56,"ratingID":144482,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":93.73,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Religion","categoryID":9,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=9&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/public.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":25,"causeName":"Religious Media and Broadcasting","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=9&cuid=25&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/religious_media.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":11702062,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":6523793,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"February, 1974","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"Bath","postalCode":"14810","streetAddress1":"P.O.

We seek to bring the Fatherhood of God to the fatherless through family structures, Christian education, and biblical self-sustainability.","websiteURL":"http://newhopeuganda.org","tagLine":"Bringing the Fatherhood of God to the fatherless","charityName":"New Hope Uganda Ministries","ein":"954570304","orgID":7503,"currentRating":{"score":82.32,"ratingID":147921,"publicationDate":"2019-12-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":75,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Religion","categoryID":9,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=9&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/public.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":26,"causeName":"Religious Activities","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=9&cuid=26&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/religious_activities.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":592398,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":2024076,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"March, 1996","nteeCode":"Q33","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"International Relief","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"SD","city":"Belle Fourche","postalCode":"57717","streetAddress1":"P.O.

We are a leader development group that identifies and develops the right leaders at the right time through the right process, so they can be released to make the greatest Kingdom impact across Asia.
