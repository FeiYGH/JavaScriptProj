We help people connect with others in their villages, build self-confidence, and find their voice because poverty is about more than just money-it's about exclusion.","websiteURL":"https://trickleup.org/","tagLine":null,"charityName":"Trickle Up","ein":"061043042","orgID":6599,"currentRating":{"score":94.13,"ratingID":145279,"publicationDate":"2019-09-03T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":92.74,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":20,"causeName":"Development and Relief Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=20&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/development_relief.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":11486558,"nteeType":"Community Improvement, Capacity Building","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":6177707,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"August, 2018","rulingDate":"June, 1981","nteeCode":"S43","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Management Services for Small Business, Entrepreneurs","accountingPeriod":"August","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"S"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10001","streetAddress1":"104 West 27th Street","streetAddress2":"12th Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/061043042/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Trickle Up","ein":"061043042","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6599&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/061043042"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10956&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The mission of the Haitian Health Foundation (HHF) is to improve the health and well-being of women, children, families and communities living in the greater Jérémie region through healthcare, education and community development..<br><br>This is accomplished through: a secondary care outpatient clinic;

Founded in 1975 by Joseph Collins and Frances Moore Lappé-author of the revolutionary bestseller Diet for a Small Planet-Food First envisions a world in which all people have access to healthy, ecologically produced and culturally appropriate food. After nearly 40 years of analysis of the global food system, we know that making this vision a reality involves more than technical solutions-it requires political transformation.

These Beit Tzipora Centers focus on educating the Ethiopian-Jewish community and giving close to 1,000 Ethiopian-Israeli young people the opportunity to grow and participate fully in Israeli society.","websiteURL":"http://www.eliewieselfoundation.org","tagLine":"Combating indifference, intolerance and injustice","charityName":"Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity","ein":"133398151","orgID":11924,"currentRating":{"score":86.36,"ratingID":142058,"publicationDate":"2019-06-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":96.72,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":81,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":19,"causeName":"International Peace, Security, and Affairs","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=19&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/international_peace.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":8687987,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":768628,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"August, 1987","nteeCode":"Q41","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Arms Control, Peace Organizations","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10022","streetAddress1":"555 Madison Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133398151/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity","ein":"133398151","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11924&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133398151"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10817&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1987, The Resource Foundation, helps donors support effective, locally-driven development programs in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Since 1988, CATW has provided widely recognized leadership in promoting legislative, policy and educational measures to raise awareness about the root causes of human trafficking.","websiteURL":"http://www.catwinternational.org","tagLine":"The World's First Organization to Fight Human Trafficking Internationally","charityName":"Coalition Against Trafficking in Women","ein":"223032134","orgID":11215,"currentRating":{"score":87.28,"ratingID":143507,"publicationDate":"2019-10-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":85.78,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":19,"causeName":"International Peace, Security, and Affairs","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=19&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/international_peace.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":845213,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":894065,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"June, 1990","nteeCode":"Q70","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"International Human Rights","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10116","streetAddress1":"P.O.

All programs are guided by the two goals of program integrity and the highest standards of stewardship to donors.","websiteURL":"http://www.iocc.org","tagLine":"Faith in Action","charityName":"International Orthodox Christian Charities","ein":"251679348","orgID":3894,"currentRating":{"score":87.62,"ratingID":147774,"publicationDate":"2019-12-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":82.5,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":20,"causeName":"Development and Relief Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=20&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/development_relief.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":18229140,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":39536510,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"April, 1992","nteeCode":"Q33","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"International Relief","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MD","city":"Baltimore","postalCode":"21204    ","streetAddress1":"110 West Road","streetAddress2":"Suite 360"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/251679348/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"International Orthodox Christian Charities","ein":"251679348","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=3894&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/251679348"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13504&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The CERGE-EI U.S. Foundation supports our founding partner CERGE-EI (Czech Republic) in promoting modern economic research, education and literacy.

We have also built more than 84,000 housing units for people desperately in need of adequate shelter, and completed more than 1,475 water projects that provide lifesaving water and sanitation to hundreds of thousands of people in need.","websiteURL":"http://www.foodforthepoor.org","tagLine":"Serving the poorest of the poor","charityName":"Food For The Poor","ein":"592174510","orgID":3714,"currentRating":{"score":86.17,"ratingID":147764,"publicationDate":"2019-11-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":80.68,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":97,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":30,"causeName":"Humanitarian Relief Supplies","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=30&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/humanitarian_relief.jpg?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":32003725,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":944365913,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"June, 1982","nteeCode":"Q33","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"International Relief","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"FL","city":"Coconut Creek","postalCode":"33073","streetAddress1":"6401 Lyons Road","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":"Moderate","active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/592174510/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Food For The Poor","ein":"592174510","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=3714&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/592174510"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=12830&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"In 1983, the Salvadoran American Humanitarian Foundation (SAHF) was formed in the United States as a vehicle to obtain donations of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and equipment and arrange shipments to El Salvador.

Through these cross-cultural partnerships, volunteer teams are presented with an amazing opportunity to build a home for a family in need. In just one week, teams transform an otherwise empty lot into a safe and secure home - complete with a concrete foundation, electricity, windows, and doors. As a result of this experience, each family receives a tangible symbol of the faithfulness and unconditional love of Jesus Christ.

Our projects are led by local partners and respond to the priorities of their communities, in a way that respects both tradition and innovation.","websiteURL":"http://www.himalayan-foundation.org","tagLine":"Bringing shelter, safety, education, health, and opportunity to the most vulnerable people in the Himalaya","charityName":"American Himalayan Foundation","ein":"942951480","orgID":5817,"currentRating":{"score":95.17,"ratingID":143867,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":93.18,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":20,"causeName":"Development and Relief Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=20&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/development_relief.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":16693306,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":"3","incomeAmount":5597653,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"April, 1981","nteeCode":"Q12","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Fund Raising and/or Fund Distribution ","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CA","city":"San Francisco","postalCode":"94133","streetAddress1":"909 Montgomery Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 400"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/942951480/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"American Himalayan Foundation","ein":"942951480","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5817&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/942951480"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5827&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Global Exchange envisions a people centered globalization that values the rights of workers and the health of the planet; that prioritizes international collaboration as central to ensuring peace; and that aims to create a local, green economy designed to embrace the diversity of our communities.

We implement these principles through the Nursing Scholarship Fund, the Elizabeth Taylor Mobile Health Clinics, and GAIA Villages (providing one-on-one care, education, and HIV prevention to rural villagers, especially orphans and those who are ill).","websiteURL":"http://www.thegaia.org","tagLine":"ENDING AIDS ONE CHILD, ONE NURSE, ONE VILLAGE AT A TIME","charityName":"Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance","ein":"943364364","orgID":11426,"currentRating":{"score":87.66,"ratingID":143515,"publicationDate":"2019-10-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":82.56,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"International","categoryID":7,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=7&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/human.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":20,"causeName":"Development and Relief Services","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=7&cuid=20&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/development_relief.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1186945,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":2473325,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"October, 2000","nteeCode":"Q23","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"International Exchanges, N.E.C.","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CA","city":"San Rafael","postalCode":"94901","streetAddress1":"2171 Francisco Blvd. East","streetAddress2":"Suite I "},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/943364364/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance","ein":"943364364","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11426&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/943364364"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11181&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Give2Asia strengthens communities throughout Asia by building trusted networks for charitable investment.
