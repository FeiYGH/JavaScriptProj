We serve as a means for donors to reach many groups and individual needs and act as an instigator of good, inspiring people to do tikkun olam and tzedakah (to do the right thing by giving) responsibly and regularly.","websiteURL":"http://www.goodpeoplefund.org/","tagLine":"Repairing the world-small actions, huge impacts","charityName":"Good People Fund","ein":"261887249","orgID":16414,"currentRating":{"score":94.69,"ratingID":142508,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":92.5,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Community Development","categoryID":10,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=10&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/religion.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":43,"causeName":"Jewish Federations","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=10&cuid=43&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/Jewish_Federation.jpg?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":261800,"nteeType":"International, Foreign Affairs and National Security","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":2100958,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"December, 2008","nteeCode":"Q30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":"International Development, Relief Services","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"Q"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NJ","city":"Millburn","postalCode":"07041","streetAddress1":"384 Wyoming Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/261887249/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Good People Fund","ein":"261887249","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=16414&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/261887249"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=18112&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Community Foundation of Greater Huntsville improves the quality of life in our community through philanthropy.

Seeking to put God's love into action, SDHFH brings people together to build homes, communities, and hope. Habitat was founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a simple, decent and affordable home to live in dignity and safety. Habitat builds homes for ownership by low-income families in need. Habitat homes are sold to Partner Families and are financed by a 0%-interest 25 to 30-year mortgage. The mortgage payments create a revolving fund that Habitat uses to construct future homes for local families in need. Families qualify for the program by showing a demonstrated need for improved housing, a willingness to partner with Habitat by committing to 250-500 hours of \"sweat equity\" helping to build their own home, and the ability to repay the 0%-interest, 25 to 30-year mortgage.","websiteURL":"http://www.sdhfh.org/","tagLine":"Building homes, communities, and hope since 1988.","charityName":"San Diego Habitat for Humanity Inc","ein":"330259190","orgID":9877,"currentRating":{"score":86.87,"ratingID":144518,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":81.44,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Community Development","categoryID":10,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=10&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/religion.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":27,"causeName":"Housing and Neighborhood Development","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=10&cuid=27&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/housing.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":19050542,"nteeType":"Housing, Shelter","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":8125792,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"January, 1987","nteeCode":"L20","groupName":"HABITAT FOR HUMANITY INTERNATIONAL                                    ","deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Subordinate - the organization is a subordinate in a group ruling.","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Housing Development, Construction, Management","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"L"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CA","city":"San Diego","postalCode":"92111","streetAddress1":"8128 Mercury Court","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/330259190/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"San Diego Habitat for Humanity Inc","ein":"330259190","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9877&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/330259190"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8525&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Seeking to put love and faith into action, Habitat for Humanity of Orange County brings people together to build homes, community and hope.

To that end, we support vital programs and services provided by our constituent agencies to ensure that needs are met: reaching out to the elderly, to children and adults with special needs, and to those facing poverty and hunger.","websiteURL":"http://www.milwaukeejewish.org","tagLine":"Caring for the community","charityName":"Milwaukee Jewish Federation","ein":"390806312","orgID":4097,"currentRating":{"score":96.2,"ratingID":141344,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":94.63,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Community Development","categoryID":10,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=10&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/religion.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":43,"causeName":"Jewish Federations","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=10&cuid=43&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/Jewish_Federation.jpg?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":230274273,"nteeType":"Philanthropy, Voluntarism and Grantmaking Foundations","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":118618346,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"July, 1947","nteeCode":"T70","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":"Fund Raising Organizations That Cross Categories","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"T"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"WI","city":"Milwaukee","postalCode":"53202    ","streetAddress1":"1360 North Prospect Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/390806312/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Milwaukee Jewish Federation","ein":"390806312","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=4097&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/390806312"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14481&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"United Way of Racine County has been helping local families since 1922.

In January 1, 2010 the Hampton Roads Community Foundation formed when the Norfolk and Virginia Beach foundations merged becoming the largest grant and scholarship provider in Hampton Roads. \r\n\r\n","websiteURL":"http://www.hamptonroadscf.org/","tagLine":"Inspiring philanthropy in southeastern Virginia since 1950","charityName":"Hampton Roads Community Foundation","ein":"542035996","orgID":5488,"currentRating":{"score":93.35,"ratingID":140213,"publicationDate":"2019-04-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":90.6,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Community Development","categoryID":10,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=10&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/religion.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":22,"causeName":"Community Foundations","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=10&cuid=22&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/community_foundations.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":348857995,"nteeType":"Philanthropy, Voluntarism and Grantmaking Foundations","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":62402132,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"September, 2001","nteeCode":"T31","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Community Foundations","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"T"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"VA","city":"Norfolk","postalCode":"23510","streetAddress1":"101 West Main Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 4500"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/542035996/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Hampton Roads Community Foundation","ein":"542035996","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5488&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/542035996"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10765&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1939, Rappahannock United Way is a local nonprofit organization serving the city of Fredericksburg, and the counties of Caroline, King George, Spotsylvania and Stafford.

Since our founding in 1984, we have helped 48 families move into new, affordable homes, which they had the unique and important pleasure of helping to build.","websiteURL":"http://www.habitatsoco.org","tagLine":"Bringing people together to build homes, communities, and hope","charityName":"Habitat for Humanity of Sonoma County","ein":"680041170","orgID":18449,"currentRating":{"score":86.63,"ratingID":150943,"publicationDate":"2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":85.4,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":88,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Community Development","categoryID":10,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=10&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/religion.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":27,"causeName":"Housing and Neighborhood Development","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=10&cuid=27&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/housing.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":6295550,"nteeType":"Housing, Shelter","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":5932622,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"January, 1987","nteeCode":"L20","groupName":"HABITAT FOR HUMANITY INTERNATIONAL                                    ","deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Subordinate - the organization is a subordinate in a group ruling.","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Housing Development, Construction, Management","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"L"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CA","city":"Santa Rosa","postalCode":"95403","streetAddress1":"1201 Piner Road","streetAddress2":"Suite 500"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/680041170/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Habitat for Humanity of Sonoma County","ein":"680041170","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=18449&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/680041170"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11537&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento partners with the community and thousands of volunteers a year to empower low-income families, seniors, and veterans to have the opportunity to build and preserve their homes and neighborhoods. <br><br>A hand-up, not handout model, Habitat homeowner partners put in 500 hours of sweat equity before purchasing their homes for an affordable mortgage.  <br><br>Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento serves over 3,000 people a year in Sacramento and Yolo County through build, preservation, and community projects.<br><br>Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento's retail recycling facility \"the ReStore\" sells donated, quality building materials and furniture at discounted rates to the general public.

We are currently working to build strong families that can provide supports necessary to assure that their children are successful, a safety net for our frail or disadvantaged populations, and the ability to maximize health and independence for all people.","websiteURL":"http://www.unitedwaysela.org/","tagLine":"Live united","charityName":"United Way of Southeast Louisiana","ein":"720471369","orgID":4626,"currentRating":{"score":85.22,"ratingID":140155,"publicationDate":"2019-05-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":80.69,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":92,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Community Development","categoryID":10,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=10&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/religion.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":42,"causeName":"United Ways","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=10&cuid=42&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/United_Way.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":19922318,"nteeType":"Philanthropy, Voluntarism and Grantmaking Foundations","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":11039014,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"November, 1952","nteeCode":"T70","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Fund Raising Organizations That Cross Categories","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"T"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"LA","city":"New Orleans","postalCode":"70119    ","streetAddress1":"2515 Canal Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/720471369/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"United Way of Southeast Louisiana","ein":"720471369","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=4626&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/720471369"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13869&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"United Way of Northeast Louisiana offers you something no one else can -- a way to join with others to identify and work on the issues our community cares about most.
