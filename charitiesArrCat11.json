FRAC works with hundreds of national, state and local nonprofit organizations, public agencies, corporations and labor organizations to address hunger, food insecurity, and their root cause, poverty. As Congress Daily has written, FRAC is “the premier anti-hunger group in Washington.” Hunger in the United States is a problem that can be cured. FRAC harnesses the nation's resources on behalf of those who need help to stave off hunger – poor children and their families, seniors, the unemployed, low-income workers, the ill, and homeless persons.","websiteURL":"http://frac.org/","tagLine":"The premier anti-hunger group in Washington","charityName":"Food Research & Action Center","ein":"237200739","orgID":16404,"currentRating":{"score":86.79,"ratingID":142506,"publicationDate":"2019-05-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":95,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":82,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Research and Public Policy","categoryID":11,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=11&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/research.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":24,"causeName":"Social and Public Policy Research","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=11&cuid=24&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/research_public_policy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":5121122,"nteeType":"Food, Agriculture and Nutrition","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":7290376,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"December, 1972","nteeCode":"K30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Food Service, Free Food Distribution Programs","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"K"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"DC","city":"Washington","postalCode":"20036","streetAddress1":"1200 Eighteenth Street NW","streetAddress2":"Suite 400"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/237200739/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Food Research & Action Center","ein":"237200739","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=16404&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/237200739"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5133&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1947, The Rodale Institute is a 333-acre education and research center and has been a leader in the science of regenerative and organic agriculture and its impact on global warming, nutrition, and human health.

The Forum also works to improve Middle East studies in North America.

Since 1947, the Foundation has funded over 200 research projects designed to discover the causes of traffic crashes, prevent them, and minimize injuries when they do occur. We have used this research to develop dozens of focused, high-impact educational materials for drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists and other road users. Government agencies and legislators--as well as automobile clubs, driving schools, and school districts--turn to the Foundation's research to guide them in creating policies that can save lives on our roads and highways, teach adults how to drive more responsibly, and teach children about vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian safety.","websiteURL":"http://www.aaafoundation.org","tagLine":"Saving lives through research and education","charityName":"AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety","ein":"520794368","orgID":8302,"currentRating":{"score":91.81,"ratingID":145384,"publicationDate":"2019-09-03T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":96.38,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Research and Public Policy","categoryID":11,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=11&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/research.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":24,"causeName":"Social and Public Policy Research","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=11&cuid=24&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/research_public_policy.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":22366474,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":7330428,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"October, 1970","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"DC","city":"Washington","postalCode":"20005","streetAddress1":"607 14th Street, NW","streetAddress2":"Suite 201"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/520794368/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety","ein":"520794368","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8302&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/520794368"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=6215&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars is the living, national memorial to President Wilson established by Congress in 1968 and headquartered in Washington, D.C.
