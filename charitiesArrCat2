We have chosen to focus on middle-school students because studies show that this is the age when children are most at risk to stop reading.","websiteURL":"http://www.nationalbook.org","tagLine":"Celebrate the best of American literature","charityName":"National Book Foundation","ein":"133347524","orgID":10671,"currentRating":{"score":84.39,"ratingID":115242,"publicationDate":"2016-11-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":90.66,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":80,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":4,"causeName":"Performing Arts","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/performing_arts.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":4133167,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":4015093,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"April, 2018","rulingDate":"September, 1986","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"April","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10004","streetAddress1":"90 Broad Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 604"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133347524/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"National Book Foundation","ein":"133347524","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10671&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133347524"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=12143&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Arts and culture workers need access to opportunities, resources, funding, advice and information to bring their visions to life.

The Mint was founded in 1992. Jonathan Bank became artistic director in 1995 and began to shape the company's mission, focusing on lost plays. Our first major success came in 1999 with the American premiere of THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE, written by Harley Granville-Barker in 1905. “A playwright, and a company, couldn't do much better,” wrote the New York Times. Our work has been recognized with an Obie Grant (2001), a special Drama Desk Award (2002), and the Theater History Museum's Theatre Preservation Award (2010) along with a host of Drama Desk and Lucille Lortel Award nominations. In fulfilling our mission, we've created some the most compelling theater in New York. As Gwen Orel wrote in the Irish Examiner “We are lucky in New York to have the Mint here. If all they did was find and stage these plays, it would be enough, but what they do is reincarnate them into striking works of art.”","websiteURL":"http://minttheater.org/","tagLine":"Lost Plays Found Here","charityName":"Mint Theater Company","ein":"133687725","orgID":15637,"currentRating":{"score":87.36,"ratingID":125017,"publicationDate":"2017-11-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":85.92,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":4,"causeName":"Performing Arts","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/performing_arts.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1385866,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":1616707,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"November, 1993","nteeCode":"A65","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":"Theater","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10036","streetAddress1":"330 West 42nd Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 1210"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133687725/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Mint Theater Company","ein":"133687725","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15637&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133687725"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=16046&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"RIOULT Dance NY is committed to supporting the creation of new works by founder and choreographer Pascal Rioult; to communicating the essence and intensity of his artistic vision; to sustaining its company of dancers; and to educating and expanding audiences for modern dance at home and through touring, nationally and internationally.

Now celebrating its 100th anniversary season, The National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene has a burgeoning creative engine, but must maintain a connection to future generations who may never have heard of Yiddish or encountered Eastern European Jewish culture in its original form. While this material has evolved in America to suit contemporary sensibilities in the form of the comedy of Jerry Seinfeld or Woody Allen, the music of Matisyahu, or nearly any musical play in the American canon, its source material is largely neglected and those seeking cultural roots are often stymied by the language barrier of Yiddish. The NYTF provides access to the treasure trove of hundreds of years of cultural expression, and with this project is seeking to inspire the imaginations of the next generation of artists to continue and contribute their own stories to this valuable work.","websiteURL":"http://nytf.org/","tagLine":"Sustaining, Dramatizing, Educating and Strengthening","charityName":"Folksbiene Yiddish Theatre","ein":"133998872","orgID":15641,"currentRating":{"score":80.28,"ratingID":144867,"publicationDate":"2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":74.38,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":4,"causeName":"Performing Arts","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/performing_arts.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1739802,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":1867864,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"November, 1998","nteeCode":"A65","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Theater","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10280","streetAddress1":"36 Battery Place","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133998872/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Folksbiene Yiddish Theatre","ein":"133998872","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15641&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/133998872"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10231&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1998, The Jacob Burns Film Center (JBFC) is a cultural arts center dedicated to presenting the best of independent, documentary, and world cinema; promoting 21st century literacy; and making film a vibrant part of the community.

We do this in an entirely non-partisan and non-ideological manner, adhering to the strictest standards of journalistic impartiality.","websiteURL":"https://www.propublica.org/","tagLine":"Journalism in the public interest","charityName":"ProPublica","ein":"142007220","orgID":13005,"currentRating":{"score":97.17,"ratingID":139712,"publicationDate":"2019-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":100,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":96,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":5,"causeName":"Public Broadcasting and Media","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/public_radio.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":40988939,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":27237842,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"December, 2018","rulingDate":"February, 2008","nteeCode":"A20","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Arts, Cultural Organizations - Multipurpose","accountingPeriod":"December","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10013","streetAddress1":"155 Avenue of the Americas","streetAddress2":"13th Floor"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/142007220/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"ProPublica","ein":"142007220","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13005&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/142007220"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8442&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Paleontological Research Institution serves society by increasing and disseminating knowledge about the history of life on Earth.

As a service to our visually-impaired listeners, READ-OUT was started in 1982 so that listeners could use a special radio to hear volunteers reading newspapers, articles, and daily advertisements.","websiteURL":"http://www.wcny.org","tagLine":"Connected to you","charityName":"Public Broadcasting Council of Central New York","ein":"160876277","orgID":5040,"currentRating":{"score":93.97,"ratingID":141425,"publicationDate":"2019-06-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":92.02,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":97,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":5,"causeName":"Public Broadcasting and Media","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/public_radio.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":18649555,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":7333341,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"March, 1965","nteeCode":"A30","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Media, Communications Organizations","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"NY","city":"Syracuse","postalCode":"13204","streetAddress1":"415 W.

Originally built as a private home in 1853, in 1908 the property was bequeathed by Robert Moffat Bruce to the Town of Greenwich. In time, growing audiences required larger facilities and the Museum was renovated and expanded. The dramatic new facility, designed by Shope Reno Wharton, opened in 1993.

Open to the public in 1990, Clayton now welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year and provides them with an intimate glimpse into the life of the Frick family a century ago.","websiteURL":"http://www.frickart.org","tagLine":"The legacy of Helen Clay Frick","charityName":"The Frick Pittsburgh","ein":"251596285","orgID":13156,"currentRating":{"score":91.75,"ratingID":148807,"publicationDate":"2019-12-20T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":96.13,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":3,"causeName":"Museums","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/museums.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":102253488,"nteeType":null,"nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":22058622,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"March, 2019","rulingDate":"April, 1989","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"March","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"PA","city":"Pittsburgh","postalCode":"15208","streetAddress1":"7227 Reynolds Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/251596285/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"The Frick Pittsburgh","ein":"251596285","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13156&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/251596285"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11128&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The AACA Museum is dedicated to the Celebration, Preservation, Education, and Display of the American Motor Vehicle history that provides value for our members, hobbyists, and the public.

Mosaic's national and international touring performances bring recognition to Detroit as a center for arts and culture and promote a positive image of metro Detroit area youth.","websiteURL":"http://www.mosaicdetroit.org","tagLine":"Excellence on stage and in life","charityName":"Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit","ein":"383069610","orgID":11360,"currentRating":{"score":80.64,"ratingID":148103,"publicationDate":"2019-12-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":74.94,"rating":2},"accountabilityRating":{"score":89,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":4,"causeName":"Performing Arts","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/performing_arts.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":1407319,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":1428706,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"August, 2018","rulingDate":"December, 1992","nteeCode":"A65","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Theater","accountingPeriod":"August","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MI","city":"Detroit","postalCode":"48207","streetAddress1":"2251 Antietam Avenue","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/383069610/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit","ein":"383069610","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=11360&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/383069610"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9297&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Sphinx Organization was founded in 1996 to help overcome the cultural stereotype of classical music, and to encourage the participation of blacks and Latinos in the field.

Included in the Collection are 15th- to 20th-century European and 17th- to 20th-century American paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, decorative arts, photographs, and folk and self-taught art.","websiteURL":"http://www.mam.org","tagLine":"Art lives here","charityName":"Milwaukee Art Museum","ein":"390806316","orgID":5310,"currentRating":{"score":93.83,"ratingID":147824,"publicationDate":"2019-12-01T05:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":91.81,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":97,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":3,"causeName":"Museums","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/museums.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":148120153,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":74902038,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"August, 2018","rulingDate":"May, 1937","nteeCode":"A51","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization that normally receives no more than one-third of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business income and at the same time more than one-third of its support from contributions, fees, and gross receipts related to exempt purposes.  509(a)(2)","nteeClassification":"Art Museums","accountingPeriod":"August","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"WI","city":"Milwaukee","postalCode":"53202","streetAddress1":"700 North Art Museum Drive","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/390806316/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Milwaukee Art Museum","ein":"390806316","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5310&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/390806316"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=8035&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Established in 1954, the mission of the Wisconsin Historical Foundation (WHF) is to strengthen the Wisconsin Historical Society's ability to fulfill its public mandate and mission to help people connect to the past.

Since opening in 2002, the Wilson Center has grown to annually welcome more than 55,000 people, including more than 10,000 students-many of whom are being introduced to the arts for the first time.","websiteURL":"https://www.wilson-center.com/","tagLine":"To be the catalyst for lifelong discovery and exploration of the arts","charityName":"Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts","ein":"391787648","orgID":15769,"currentRating":{"score":78.38,"ratingID":134245,"publicationDate":"2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/2starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/2stars.png"},"rating":2,"financialRating":{"score":69.43,"rating":1},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":4,"causeName":"Performing Arts","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/performing_arts.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":8445554,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":2583271,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"August, 2018","rulingDate":"June, 1994","nteeCode":"A61","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Performing Arts Centers","accountingPeriod":"August","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"WI","city":"Brookfield","postalCode":"53045","streetAddress1":"3270 Mitchell Park Drive","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/391787648/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts","ein":"391787648","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15769&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/391787648"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=5322&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"The Ten Chimneys Foundation was formed in 1996 to preserve and share the buildings, furnishings, collections, and grounds of a national treasure - Ten Chimneys, the estate created by Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne.

Our print magazine with a reputation for incisive reporting and accessible long-form analysis, our continuously updated website, and three topical newsletters enable the Prospect to wield outsized influence in today's 24/7 news environment.","websiteURL":"http://www.prospect.org/","tagLine":"Progressive Media & Nonprofit Publishing","charityName":"The American Prospect","ein":"521617061","orgID":7121,"currentRating":{"score":75.01,"ratingID":134696,"publicationDate":"2018-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/2starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/2stars.png"},"rating":2,"financialRating":{"score":68,"rating":1},"accountabilityRating":{"score":85,"rating":3}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":5,"causeName":"Public Broadcasting and Media","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=5&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/public_radio.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":688195,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":1266789,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"June, 2019","rulingDate":"May, 1989","nteeCode":"A33","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Printing, Publishing","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"DC","city":"Washington","postalCode":"20005","streetAddress1":"1225 Eye Street NW","streetAddress2":"Suite 600"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521617061/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"The American Prospect","ein":"521617061","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=7121&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/521617061"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=18335&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded by award-winning actor Max McLean, Fellowship for Performing Arts (FPA) is a not-for-profit New York City-based production company producing theatre from a Christian worldview to engage a diverse audience.

No longer a single venue downtown, the new name reflects the inclusive impact we aim to achieve on the performing arts community and the region as a whole.","websiteURL":"http://rpaalliance.com/","tagLine":"Enriching the quality of life in the Richmond community","charityName":"Richmond Performing Arts Alliance","ein":"542028439","orgID":9875,"currentRating":{"score":90.86,"ratingID":144517,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":89.86,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":92,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":4,"causeName":"Performing Arts","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/performing_arts.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":122949430,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":null,"incomeAmount":2499261,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"December, 2001","nteeCode":"A61","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Performing Arts Centers","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"VA","city":"Richmond","postalCode":"23219","streetAddress1":"600 East Grace Street","streetAddress2":"Suite 400"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/542028439/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Richmond Performing Arts Alliance","ein":"542028439","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9875&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/542028439"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=10667&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1953, the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra (RSO) is the largest professional orchestra in Virginia west of Richmond.

With help from teachers, local artists and musicians and Kentucky Opera professionals, the students compose music, write librettos, design sets and costumes and perform their opera in front of a live audience.","websiteURL":"http://kyopera.org/","tagLine":"Aims to give performance of operas and operettas of all types","charityName":"Kentucky Opera","ein":"616013111","orgID":15156,"currentRating":{"score":87.96,"ratingID":145841,"publicationDate":"2019-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3,"financialRating":{"score":84.98,"rating":3},"accountabilityRating":{"score":92,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":4,"causeName":"Performing Arts","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=4&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/performing_arts.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":4567713,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"Z","incomeAmount":3389325,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"May, 2018","rulingDate":"January, 1968","nteeCode":"A6A","groupName":null,"deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Opera","accountingPeriod":"May","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"KY","city":"Louisville","postalCode":"40202","streetAddress1":"323 West Broadway","streetAddress2":"Suite 601"},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/616013111/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Kentucky Opera","ein":"616013111","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=15156&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/616013111"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9631&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Louisville Ballet, the official ballet of the commonwealth of Kentucky, was founded in March 1952 as a civic ballet company.

SBMA's strong education and outreach program is multi-faceted: docent-led tours for children and adults, classroom slide talks, family days at the Museum, teacher workshops, lectures, adult education classes, and studio art classes for all ages at the Ridley-Tree Education Center at McCormick House.","websiteURL":"http://sbmuseart.org/","tagLine":"Integrating art into the lives of people","charityName":"Santa Barbara Museum of Art","ein":"951664122","orgID":9109,"currentRating":{"score":93.82,"ratingID":147472,"publicationDate":"2019-11-01T04:00:00.000Z","ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4,"financialRating":{"score":91.27,"rating":4},"accountabilityRating":{"score":100,"rating":4}},"category":{"categoryName":"Arts, Culture, Humanities","categoryID":2,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=2&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/arts.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":3,"causeName":"Museums","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=2&cuid=3&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/museums.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":115573546,"nteeType":"Arts, Culture and Humanities","nteeSuffix":"0","incomeAmount":37238801,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Educational Organization","latest990":"June, 2018","rulingDate":"April, 1985","nteeCode":"A51","groupName":"SANTA BARBARA MUSEUM OF ART                                           ","deductibilityCode":"1","affiliation":"Central - the organization is a parent (group ruling) and is not a church or 501(c)(1) organization.","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":"Art Museums","accountingPeriod":"June","deductibilityDetail":null,"exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","nteeLetter":"A"},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"CA","city":"Santa Barbara","postalCode":"93101","streetAddress1":"1130 State Street","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/951664122/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Santa Barbara Museum of Art","ein":"951664122","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=9109&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/951664122"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=4425&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Opened in 1926, the historic San Diego Museum of Art (SDMA) provides a rich and diverse cultural experience for 350,000 visitors annually.
